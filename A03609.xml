            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>Firſt, the manner of the worke on Gods part: and this diſcovers it ſelfe in theſe two particulars.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In propoſing Chriſt in the Miniſterie
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:4399:5"/>
of the Goſpell, as the moſt beautifull ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject which the ſoule can view or affect; <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2.12. <hi>Cant.</hi> 5.9. <hi>with</hi> 6.1.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That God doth by an holy kind of vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence plucke the ſinner from ſinne to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe; as in that place, <hi>Iohn</hi> 6.44. <hi>No man can come to me, except the Father which hath ſent me, draw him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſecond is on our part; a frame and temper of the heart that God workes upon us by this holy kind of violent drawing. This diſcovers it ſelfe in theſe two parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars: <list>
                     <item>1 Contrition.</item>
                     <item>2 Humiliation.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>For the handling of theſe two, wee have choſen this place of Scripture. And I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend not to trade with every particular in the Verſe, but ſo much in it as fitteth my intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in hand.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Expoſ.</note>That which I aime at, is in the middle of the Verſe: <hi>I dwell with him that is of a bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken heart.</hi> Give me leave to open the words. The great God of heaven, that inhabiteth eternity in glory, for the comfort of every poore broken-hearted ſinner,<note place="margin">Gods two houſes.</note> ſaith, hee <hi>will dwell with him.</hi> The Lord hath but two ſtanding houſes; the one is in heaven in glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, the other is every broken heart, and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſhivered ſoule.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">How he dwels in the heart.</note>Now how doth God dwell in the heart
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:4399:5"/>
of a poore ſinner? The Apoſtle, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 3.17. tells us, <hi>Chriſt dwells in our hearts by faith:</hi> and it implies the conſtant abode of Chriſt by his Spirit in the ſoule, being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, and entertained by faith. So that firſt there muſt bee a broken heart, before there can bee faith, or before Chriſt will dwell in our hearts to our comfort. Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der what a kind of heart it muſt be wherein God will dwell. It muſt bee an humble and a ſhivered ſpirit. Hee dwells in heaven by his glory: yet, though thou wert as low as hell in thy ſelfe, God will come and take poſſeſſion of thy heart marvellous graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly.</p>
               <p>In the words, ſo farre as they concerne my purpoſe, the thing mainly obſervable is, the neceſſitie, and excellencie of this broken and humble ſoule. It is the only receptacle of the Lord Ieſus Chriſt. If you will have Chriſt and grace to dwell in you, you muſt get humble ſpirits.</p>
               <p>
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Doct. </seg>
                  </label> So the Doctrine in generall from hence is this: <hi>The ſoule muſt bee broken and humbled,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">None but the broken heart is an houſe for Chriſt.</note> 
                  <hi>before the Lord Ieſus Chriſt can, or will dwell therein, and before faith can be wrought there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in.</hi> There muſt bee contrition, before there will bee an inhabitation of Chriſt in the ſoule.</p>
               <p>As men, ſpecially great men, will have their houſes ayred, before they come to lie
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:4399:6"/>
there; ſo this contrition is the ayring, or ſweeping of the ſoule, that ſo it may be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habited.<note place="margin">Foretold.</note> This was typified and foretold in the old law. When the people of Iſrael were to goe into the Land of Canaan (which ſhadowed the kingdome of grace here, and of glory hereafter) they muſt goe through the vaſt, terrible, troubleſome, and roaring wilderneſſe, and through thoſe ſtreights and extreme hazzards, before God brought them to the Land of Promiſe. Whereby the Lord typified thus much unto us, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the ſoule can bee truely poſſeſſed of Chriſt, it muſt goe through theſe rockie wayes of contrition and humiliation, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 2.14. <hi>Therefore behold, I will allure her, and bring her into the wilderneſſe,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ad aperien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam ſpem. Hieron.</note> 
                  <hi>and ſpeake comfortably to her.</hi> And in verſ. 15. <hi>I will give her the valley of Achor for the dore of hope, and ſhee ſhall ſing there, as in the dayes of her youth, and as in the dayes when ſhe came out of Egypt.</hi> Compare that 15. verſe with <hi>Ioſhua</hi> 7.25.<note place="margin">The ſlood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate of ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, a dore of hope.</note> The doore of hope is nothing elſe, but the expectation of all good things from God, which hee hath promiſed. And here remember the ſtory of Achor: <hi>Achan</hi> had ſtollen the wedge of gold, and the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byloniſh garment, and therefore God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted away from the Campe. Now the Lord purſued him, and cauſed the people to ſtone him with ſtones; and they called the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:4399:6"/>
place, <hi>The Valley of Achor, to this day,</hi> .i. The Valley of trouble and affliction. The Lord hath reference to his former dealing As he did before in the time of <hi>Ioſhua;</hi> hee firſt ſubdued <hi>Achan,</hi> and then hee gave them ſucceſſe againſt all their adverſaries: (As if he had ſaid, I will give them the Valley of contrition and humiliation for the Gate to all comfort and ſweet refreſhing, here and hereafter:) So you muſt goe through the wilderneſſe to this Valley of Achor, before you can come to this doore of hope, to this Land of Canaan: you muſt ſtone theſe cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions of yours, which have troubled the Spirit of God, and then there is a doore of hope ſet open for you.</p>
               <p>And as it was foretold, ſo it was the end why the Lord Ieſus Chriſt was ſent: as <hi>Iſa.</hi> 61.12. <hi>The Spirit of the Lord is upon mee,</hi> (ſaith <hi>Iſaiah</hi> in the ſtead of Chriſt,) <hi>becauſe the Lord hath annointed mee to preach glad tydings unto the meeke, hee hath ſent mee to bind up the broken-hearted, to proclaime li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie to the captives, and to comfort all that mourne.</hi> Nay,<note place="margin">2. Accompli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed.</note> the Lord hath not onely ſent Chriſt to this end, and promiſed this, but he hath done as hee did promiſe. And this is the condition upon which he hath promiſed and given all comfort to his people: as in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 34.18. <hi>The Lord is nigh unto them that are of a broken heart, and ſaveth ſuch as be of
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:4399:7"/>
a contrite ſpirit.</hi> Hee is neere them, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort them, and to aſſiſt them, and deliver them: and thus the Saints of God have found it; as 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 33.12. where the Text ſaith, that <hi>Manaſſes humbled himſelfe migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily before the Lord, and hee found peace to his ſoule, and the Lord pardoned his ſinne.</hi> Hee was a mighty ſinner, and had mighty rebellions, and mighty pride of heart, and therefore the Lord laid him as low as the duſt, though hee were a King. As hee had beene a mighty ſinner, ſo hee was now a mighty patterne of humiliation, and the Lord had mercy on him.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Two reaſons of the point.</note>The reaſons and grounds of Gods diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation this way; are theſe two eſpecially.</p>
               <p n="1">1 Whether we conſider the receiving of faith, and Chriſt with it; or,</p>
               <p n="2">2 The keeping and maintaining of faith, being received. In both theſe it is plaine, that God will breake our hearts, before hee gives us Chriſt or faith. I ſay, it is neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in the way of his providence.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſ. </seg>1</label> 1 It is an eſpeciall meanes to make way for faith, and for Chriſt, becauſe all the lets and impediments which hinder the entrance of faith into the ſoule, are removed by hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation and brokenneſſe of ſpirit.<note place="margin">Two letts of faith remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenneſſe of heart.</note> Now beſides many other bolts and ſprings (as in a locke there are many ſprings and little bolts, beſides the maine bolt; ſo I ſay) there are two
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:4399:7"/>
maine bolts which make the ſoule uncapable of faith, which being removed, faith will come into the ſoule.</p>
               <p>The firſt let which is an hinderance to the worke of faith, is this:<note place="margin">1 <hi>Lett.</hi> To ſeek con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment in the naturall condition.</note> there is a ſettled kind of contentment which the ſoule taketh up in its owne eſtate: and the heart of a ſinfull creature ſitteth downe well apaid in that ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full miſerable condition wherein he is, and hee deſireth no other; nay, hee would have no change in this kind. This is one maine bolt which ſtoppeth the way, and keepeth faith from comming into the heart. This is the frame of every mans heart naturally. So we ſee in <hi>Deut.</hi> 29.19. <hi>And if it come to paſſe, that when hee heareth the words of this curſe, that he bleſſe himſelfe in his heart, ſaying, I ſhall have peace, though I walke in the imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of mine owne heart, or adde drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to thirſt: The Lord will not ſpare him, but the anger of the Lord, and his jealouſie ſhall ſmoake againſt that man, and all the cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes that are written in this booke, ſhall fall upon him, and the Lord ſhall blot his name from un<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>der heaven.</hi> People bleſſe themſelves in their condition, notwithſtanding all the promiſes of bleſſing, and threatning of judgement. If any man have ſuch a root of bitterneſſe in him, and ſhall bleſſe himſelfe in this condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and ſay, I will promiſe my felfe an hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py end, let <hi>Moſes</hi> threaten what he can: I tell
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:4399:8"/>
thee, the wrath of the Lord ſhall ſmoake a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt that man. See that notable place in <hi>Iob</hi> 21.14. It imports ſo much: For they ſaid to God, <hi>Depart from us; for wee deſire not the knowledge of thy wayes:</hi> that is, wee are as we would be. When wholſome coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels and exhortations are miniſtred, namely, that they would take up a better courſe, and be more holy before God, and yeeld obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to him in his Word; and the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter biddeth them take a farewell of their pleaſures and profits, and they thinke wee invite them to loſſe: now all the while that a poore ſinner quiets his heart in this condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it is meerely impoſſible, (in the courſe of providence,) nay, it is a flat contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that ever grace ſhould be beſtowed upon that ſoule, or that ever faith ſhould come there. For faith purgeth the heart, whereſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it comes: as the Apoſtle ſaith, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.17. <hi>All things are become new, all old things are paſſed away.</hi> There muſt be a new frame of the heart, and a new courſe of life and converſation. Now for the ſoule to approve of its condition, and yet deſire to goe out of it, theſe two cannot ſtand together in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; and therefore know, that while people pleaſe themſelves in this condition, and, let the Miniſter ſay, what the will, and let God reveale what hee will, ſtill they thinke they cannot be in a better eſtate: I ſay it is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:4399:8"/>
that ever, upon theſe termes, faith ſhould come into the heart: for faith will bring a change. Therefore when the Lord will doe good to a ſoule, hee will make him ſee his ſinnes, and make him weary of them, and tire him with the ſenſe of his condition, and ſhew him the neceſſity of faith, and that he muſt be a new man: and then he is content to take that way, whereby he may be better diſpoſed of by the Spirit of God. In the Goſpell the phraſe is this,<note place="margin">Mat. 9.12.</note> 
                  <hi>The whole need not the Phyſitian.</hi> He thinkes himſelfe well, and therefore what need he goe to Phyſick? And it is ſo in common reaſon. No man can reare up a new houſe, but he muſt firſt pull downe the old. If a man be fiſh-whole, what need doth he ſee of Chriſt? as many people ſee no need of this humbling, and this ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and they thinke they love God in their owne apprehenſion, and therefore they qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et themſelves in that condition. But God will plucke downe this old frame, and then there is a way to build a new frame in the heart. Before the heart is broken, the ſoule would not bee otherwiſe, and therefore it cannot be content to be under the power of faith, which would worke a change of the heart.</p>
               <p>The ſecond maine hinderance of faith is this:<note place="margin">2. <hi>Let.</hi> To ſeeke a ſufficiencie at home:</note> Suppoſe the ſoule were ſenſible of its condition, and were wounded and broken,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:4399:9"/>
and could bee content to have eaſe and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe: yet the ſoule ſeeketh for ſuccour from its owne ſufficiencie: and when as the Word hath diſcovered our condition unto us, and now we ſee we have need of reliefe, we have recourſe to ſome ſhift of our owne. And this doth wonderfully croſſe and oppoſe faith: nay, faith cannot come into the ſoule, till the Lord undermine this corruption of heart. This is a fruit of <hi>Adams</hi> rebellion; for when the Lord put into his hands a ſtocke of grace, that hee was made perfectly happy and righteous, and able to doe whatſoever God commanded, while hee continued in this eſtate of innocencie, hee needed not to goe out of himſelfe to find ſuccour and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe, he had no need of Chriſt. This is the ſinfull temper that hangeth upon all the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteritie of <hi>Adam,</hi> that (though fallen from God) we will ſcramble for our owne com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, and doe what wee can by our owne ſtrength to procure comfort, and eaſe, and ſhelter to our owne ſoules in the day of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſe. Happely God layeth a man upon his ſicke bed, and awakeneth his conſcience; and in this condition men will promiſe and reſolve any thing, that, if God would ſpare them, they would doe any dutie to get Gods favour toward them; and they thinke it is ſome outward reformation of ſome ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly practiſes that will give God contentment:
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:4399:9"/>
and ſo they reſt in themſelves ſtill. And hence it is, that after a great deale of hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror of conſcience, in concluſion they fall backe to their old courſes, or elſe they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent themſelves with an outward and overly reformation of life, and take up a calme ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilized courſe, till they come to their death<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, and then their hearts faile them: and the reaſon is this, becauſe the heart was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver throughly humbled. And it may be a man thinkes, if he ſhall now pray, and heare, and doe ſome duties, then all will bee well, never ſeeing an utter inſufficiencie in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, that hee may receive mercie from the Lord. This is the loweſt and laſt hinderance of all, and there is nothing more croſſe to faith than this. It is commonly the ſhift that Satan puts upon men in their troubles, meerely to make them doe ſomething out of their good parts, and good gifts, and there to reſt themſelves, and ſo to ſinke downe into the Pit before they bee aware. Now this croſſeth the worke of faith:<note place="margin">By faith the ſoule goeth out to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for all-ſufficiencie.</note> for the nature of faith is this; it is the going out of the ſoule to another, and to ſee all ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciencie in another, and to fetch all from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother. To have ſupply in a mans ſelfe, and to ſee all-ſufficiencie in Chriſt, theſe two cannot ſtand together. So that while the ſoule is thus poſſeſſed with his owne ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encie to procure eaſe to himſelfe, it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:4399:10"/>
this ſtops the worke of faith, and hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders the pouring in of faith into the ſoule, whereby you ſhould goe wholly out of your ſelves, and fetch all from Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Therefore marke now what followes. As contrition tooke away the former hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, ſo the Lord hath this worke of humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation, whereby hee ſhuts backe this bolt, and makes him to ſee an utter inabilitie in himſelfe to procure or receive any good. For there are many ſinnes which formerly he hath committed, and many weakneſſes and wants whereof he is guilty. Now when this is done, then the barre is removed, and the lets taken away by theſe two, contrition and humiliation. Conſider that place 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.18. <hi>If any man would be wiſe, hee muſt be a foole, that he may be wiſe:</hi> and if any man will be made rich, hee muſt ſee himſelfe poore; and if any man will have ſuccour in his mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerie, he muſt ſee himſelfe unable to relieve himſelfe; and then the Lord will doe it for him. There cannot be faith in the ſoule, if either of theſe doe remaine in the ſoule ſtill. Now theſe being taken away, the ſoule is fit to receive the worke of faith.<note place="margin">Simile.</note> As it is with a man that would take a graft from a tree, and graft it into a new ſtocke, firſt it muſt be cut off from the old, and then, ſecondly, be pared and made fit for the other: ſo it is here; all the ſinfull ſonnes of men grow upon the root
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:4399:10"/>
of <hi>Adams</hi> rebellion, and wee proſper and thrive there. <hi>Adam</hi> was the old and wild O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live, and Chriſt the true Vine, and the new Olive. Now before wee can be tranſplanted from the old Olive into the true Olive, God muſt firſt cut us off from our old ſinnes by contrition; and ſecondly, pare us and fit us by humiliation: and then wee are fit to be ingrafted into Chriſt. Where theſe two graces are wrought, the ſoule cannot be void of faith: and as ſurely as God is in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, hee will undoubtedly poure faith into the ſoule.</p>
               <p>So the ſubſtance is this: If by this broken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of heart, and this contrition and humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation of ſpirit, the two maine barres and lets of faith are removed, then it is neceſſary that God worke this in the ſoule. But the firſt part is cleered, and marvellous plaine, and therefore the other cannot be denied. If you will be in your ſinnes, and in yo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="2">2. This brokenneſſe of heart is marvel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous neceſſary,<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſ. </seg>2</label> becauſe by this meanes faith is preſerved. For when the heart is truly broken, there followes this thing; The ſoule prizeth faith and Chriſt, and is thankfull for the leaſt mercy God giveth. Hee that ſtands
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:4399:11"/>
in need, will be thankfull for any mercy or favour: as in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 35.10. <hi>All my bones ſhall ſay, Lord, who is like unto thee?</hi> Me thinkes I ſee <hi>David</hi> in his diſtreſſe, beſieged with many miſeries: and when the Lord had eaſed him, and freed him, ſee how hee reaſons with himſelfe: O Lord, the heart that thou haſt healed, this broken ſpirit that thou haſt bound up; nay, all theſe bones which were once ſhattered all to pieces, thou haſt ſet them againe, and they ſhall ſay, <hi>Lord, who is like unto thee?</hi> As if hee had ſaid, Here is mercy indeed, for mine heart hath found it, and mine eye hath ſeene it, and mine hands, and all my bones can ſay, <hi>Lord, who is like unto thee?</hi> Before he was burthened with his ſins, and now he prizeth mercy wonderful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. One dramme of faith is worth a hundred thouſand worlds to a weary burthened ſoule. As it was with the Iewes, they had a yeare of Iubilee, wherein every ſervant was ſet free, and every bondman, and every debtour ſet at libertie: this is nothing elſe but the yeare of the Goſpell,<note place="margin">The accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble yeare of the Lord, Eſa. 91:2.</note> and the glad tydings of Salvation that is offered to all in the ſame. The Maſter, or hee that lent the money, cared not for this yerre; but the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant and the borrowers, they only longed for that yeare, and for that day, that they might be delivered. So it is here with a poore ſoule: he that never felt the burthen, nor the
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:4399:11"/>
bondage of ſinne, cares not for the glad ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings of the Goſpell; but the poore oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed creature, that hath beene in the houſe of bondage by Satan tempting, and his owne ſinfull heart plaguing him, when the day of ſalvation is offered, he receives it thankfully. And, as the ſoule prizeth grace, ſo it will hardly part with it, when it hath it, becauſe it was got with ſo much difficulty. We uſe to ſay, Lightly come, lightly goe: but when the ſoule hath gotten faith with ſo much dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty, and had many troubles of ſoule, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ever God gave an aſſured evidence of his love and favour, hee will not ſuffer ſinne or Satan to plucke it away. Oh, it coſt him many a heavie heart, and many a trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome day, before he got a little mercy, and ſhall hee now part with it for a little pleaſure or profit? that he will never doe.</p>
               <p>Then it is very reaſonable, that God ſhould wound a man, and breake his heart to make him taſte his meat, and to reliſh mercy. Thus you ſee the heart muſt bee broken and humbled, before the Lord Chriſt will come to dwell therein.</p>
               <p>Now what's the Uſe?</p>

If this be Gods way, that before he will come into the ſoule, he muſt have the heart fitted and prepared, the houſe muſt bee
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:4399:12"/>
ayred: then (I ſay) it confutes the conceits of a company of carnall perſons that bee in the world.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The meere civill Profeſſour, that would ſleepe in a whole skinne: hee could be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to have heaven, and mercy, and hee ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth he is in the right way; but this melting of the ſoule, and this bruiſing of the heart is more than God requireth, or more than God looketh for: onely he hath invented a new way, and a ſhorter cut to heaven than ever God revealed. Hee thinkes ſome me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy man only may bee troubled and perplexed; but otherwiſe it is not that which God requireth at the hands of men. And therefore after a ſleepie kind of profeſſion, without any life, or power, or ſoundneſſe, he goes on: <hi>Iob</hi> 21.13. <hi>They ſpend their dayes in eaſe,</hi> ſaith the Text, <hi>and in a moment goe downe to hell.</hi> There are a world of poore ſinners that are thus deluded: and becauſe God hath given them ſome reſtraining grace to keepe them within compaſſe, therefore they goe on in a kind of chearfull conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedneſſe, and thinke that all is well. And when they come to their ſicke-beds,<note place="margin">In ſickneſſe falſe comfort fayleth,</note> they have nothing to ſay for themſelves; nay, we cannot force comfort upon them, for then they flie out, and ſay it is not for them. And if wee tell them of what they have done, and that they have made a faire profeſſion,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:4399:12"/>
and have prayed, and done many duties, and beene well accounted of, and ſo forth: ſee what they anſwer: It is true, I have done this, or that, but this is onely the outſide: but oh, this heart of mine was never broken truely; onely I reformed my ſelfe outwardly, and made a profeſſion indeed, but the bottome was never truly laid. As it is in ſailing, ſo it is in living. Though a man have a faire calme day, and ſee the Sunne, yet this will not bring him to the haven: he muſt have a wind to drive the ſhip. So it is with many a ſinfull creature in the world: hee puts forth to Sea, and he will needes goe to heaven, and taketh a ſweet kinde of ſleepie lazie courſe, and will reforme himſelfe outwardly, but his heart was never broken nor humbled: hee will never be landed, before hee was never toſſed. Toſſed hee muſt bee, and that with ſome violence too: but this man that was never troubled, ſhall never bee comforted. I have obſerved it; as it was in the materiall Temple which <hi>Solomon</hi> built, all the ſtones were hewed and poliſhed before they were put in the building: ſo here Chriſt is the Temple, and every true Chriſtian is a ſtone for it, as the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.5. <hi>Ye alſo as liuely ſtones be made a ſpiritual houſe.</hi> Will the ſtones come cloſe together in any building, except firſt they be hewed and fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted? or wil the heart ever come to cloſe with

Take heed how you ſinne: for if you doe, you muſt weepe out your eyes, and mope out your dayes in a corner, even for ever. Good Lord, is it poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible that ever there ſhould reſt ſuch inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane, deſperate, divelliſh prophanneſſe in the heart of any man upon earth? Let mee preſſe a paſſage or two to this end, that ſuch as are guiltie of this ſinne, may take notice of it; as there are too many of them in this age. This argues a man almoſt forſaken of God, and (I had almoſt ſaid) reſerved to
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:4399:13"/>
everlaſting deſtruction. There is no greater token, that God never purpoſeth any good to that man. Conſider that place in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 69.23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28. The holy Prophet makes many fearful imprecations, as though he would pluck juſtice from heaven: <hi>Let their eyes be darkened that they ſee not; and make their loynes continually to ſhake. Poure out thine indignation upon them, and let thy wrath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full anger take hold upon them.</hi> Oh what a ſtrange paſſage is this, that a man that was inward with God, ſhould rend the heavens to pull downe vengeance thence for ſuch men! Who are all theſe? Surely they were ſome Divels incarnate, and no men, that Gods Prophet would pray againſt: <hi>Let their habitation bee deſolate, and no man to dwell in their tents.</hi> Why? what's the matter? <hi>For they perſecute him whom thou haſt ſmitten, and they talke to the griefe of thoſe whom thou haſt wounded. Lord</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>adde iniquitie to their iniquity, and let them not come into thy righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe.</hi> You that are guilty of this, conſider it. Me-thinkes it might make the ſoule of a ſinful man to ſhake at the hearing of it. When God hath wounded the heart, and awakened the conſcience, and the Lord hath ſpoken bitter things to his heart, wilt thou grieve thoſe that God hath ſmitten? It is an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a man whom God hath devoted to deſtruction. Were a mans eyes opened, and
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:4399:14"/>
his conſcience awakened, it would make him tremble. Thou that haſt bin an enemy to the Saints of God, and becauſe the Saints of God cry mightily, and dare not doe as they have done, to joyne with thee in thy wicked cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes; wilt thou (I ſay) reproach them, and lay more burthen upon them, and ſay, What, you have had Sermons enow? Now you are wounded, and you muſt mourne, and you muſt be holy. The God of heaven hath ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken this by his holy Prophet <hi>David,</hi> who knew thoſe wicked wretches. Though I know none ſuch (it may be) for the while, yet no queſtion there be ſuch in the Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation. He that now makes a mocke of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition, ſhall breake for ever; and he that will not now be broken, ſhall have the wrath of God to burne in his heart for ever in hell. The Lord in mercy breake the hearts of ſuch men, and make them to ſay, Good Lord, is this the brand of a reprobate? and what? ſhall my name be blotted out of the booke of life? I have perſecuted ſuch and ſuch a man, and ſuch a woman: the Lord grieved him, and I grieved him too. His was the ſorrow, but mine was the ſin, and ſhall bee my ſhame for ever, for ought I know.</p>
               <p>Another paſſage is, <hi>Deu.</hi> 25.17, 18, 19. When the people of Iſrael came from Egypt, <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lek</hi> tooke advantage againſt them when they were weake. <hi>Remember</hi> (ſaith the Text)
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:4399:14"/>
                  <hi>what Amalek did unto thee by the way, when you came forth of Egypt; How hee ſmote thee when thou wert faint and weary. Therefore it ſhall be when the Lord thy God ſhall give thee reſt from all thine enemies, that thou ſhalt blot out the remembrance of Amalek from under heaven.</hi> And 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15.2.3. ſeventy yeares after, the Lord remembred that. For the Text ſaith, <hi>I remember what Amalek did to Iſrael, how hee laid wait for him in the way when he came out of Egypt. Now therefore goe and ſmite Amalek, and utterly deſtroy all that they have, both infants and ſucklings, and ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en,</hi> and the like. What this <hi>Amalek</hi> did, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven ſo doe theſe wicked men. When a poore ſoule is humbled, and will forſake his ſinnes and his wicked wayes, and he groweth faint and feeble-hearted, and wonderfull heavie burthened, wilt thou now turne <hi>Amalek?</hi> Wilt thou kill him that is now burthened under the heavie wrath of God? and wilt thou now raile upon him? Curſe <hi>Amalek. I will remember him,</hi> ſaith God. Take heed leſt God remember thee, and root out thee and thy poſteritie from under heaven. Nay, the Lord himſelfe, and all the Saints doe rejoyce in the ruine and deſtruction of an ungodly wretch: as in the example of <hi>Doeg, Pſalme</hi> 52.3, 4, 5. <hi>Thou loveſt evill more than good, and lying rather then to ſpeake righteouſneſſe. Selah. Thou loveſt all

devouring words, O thou falſe tongue God ſhall likewiſe deſtroy thee for ever, hee ſhall take thee away, and plucke thee out of thy dwelling place. Selah.</hi> Thou loveſt grieving words.

The Divels themſelves will rejoyce in thy torments, and ſay, What, are you become like to us? This is the man that ſcorned to bee humbled, and to have his heart broken: what, is hee come downe to hell now? The hearts of the damned ſhall be enlarged to glory in thy confuſion. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed if a poore ſoule feele any weight of ſin upon him, then all the Towne is up in armes againſt him. Oh ſee your ſinne, and goe and breake your hearts for this ſinne.

<pb n="30" facs="tcp:4399:19"/>
the ſoule to receive and entertaine the Lord Ieſus Chriſt; and ſecondly, there muſt be an implantation of the ſoule into Chriſt: and then being thus ingrafted into Chriſt, it hath a title to all thoſe good things which he hath purchaſed for his Elect. For the concluſion of Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> is peremptory in this kind,<note place="margin">Iohn 3.36.</note> 
                  <hi>He that hath the Sonne</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>hath life; and he that hath not the Sonne hath not life.</hi> As if hee ſhould ſay, There is no hope of receiving any good from the ſtocke, unleſſe the graft bee implanted into the ſtocke: before the foule be cut off from the rebellion of <hi>Adam,</hi> it cannot be implanted into Chriſt, and unleſſe it bee ingrafted into Chriſt, it can have no comfort from him. But if we can once get into Chriſt, we ſhall have the participation of all ſpiritual things which he hath prepared for his choſen. But it is impoſſible for fleſh and bloud thus to enter into Chriſt, and be implanted into him: and therefore that wee maybe implanted into him, we muſt be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared. Firſt, there muſt be a preparation of the ſoule to be in Chriſt, before it can bee made partaker of Chriſt and his benefits. This preparation is the fitting of a ſinner, for his being in Chriſt.</p>
               <p>The Lord Chriſt being to come in perſon, and to take upon him the miniſtery of the Goſpell, he ſent <hi>Iohn</hi> the Baptiſt as his Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binger to prepare his wayes, and therefore
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:4399:19"/>
he was indued with all gifts this way: He had the ſpirit of thunder, hee was indued with the <hi>ſpirit and power of Elias,</hi> to make the way plaine for the Lord Chriſt Ieſus: and in that ſpirit hee came and preached to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly men, and taught them repentance: he came to levell mountaines, and make crook<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked things ſtraight: to turne the hearts of the fathers to the children, and the diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to the wiſedome of the juſt; <hi>to make rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy a people prepared for the Lord.</hi> This was Saint <hi>Iohns</hi> taske, to prepare mens hearts for the receiving and entertaining of Chriſt when he ſhould come. The point of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine to bee obſerved from hence is this:</p>

                  <hi>before he can have any heart to entertaine him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is the maine ſcope of the Text, the maine drift of <hi>Iohn Baptiſt</hi> his miniſtery: The hearts of men were not fitted for Chriſt, and therefore he was ſent before Chriſt Ieſus, to make way for him, and to make peoples hearts fit to receive Chriſt, that when the Lord Ieſus came, he might take place in his, and worke effectually in the ſoules of his, to their everlaſting peace. For the proofe of the Doctrine, it is that which was propheſied before, <hi>Mal.</hi> 3.1. for this Prophet was the laſt of the Prophets: for <hi>Iohn</hi> the Baptiſts
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:4399:20"/>
was a kind of intermingled miniſterie, it was neither Propheticall, nor Apoſtolicall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly. Marke what <hi>Malachy</hi> ſpeakes there of him;<note place="margin">Mal. 3.1.</note> 
                  <hi>Behold</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>I will ſend my meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger, and he ſhall prepare the way before me, and the Lord whom you ſeeke ſhall ſuddenly come to his Temple.</hi> It is plaine to bee obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, that <hi>Iohn</hi> the Baptiſt is there propheſied of. The Iewes ſought for a Meſſias, and for comfort through Chriſt; now <hi>Iohn</hi> the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt was to make way for Chriſt; and when the way was prepared, then the Lord would ſtay no longer,<note place="margin">Mal. 3.1.</note> but would <hi>ſuddenly come in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his Temple</hi> (ſaith the Text) that is, into the ſoules of his children that were willing to receive him upon ſuch termes as hee offered himſelfe. And as this was propheſied of <hi>Iohn</hi> the Baptiſt, ſo it was alſo performed by the miniſterie of <hi>Iohn, Luke</hi> 3.4. <hi>The voyce of one crying in the wilderneſſe, Prepare yee the way of the Lord, make his paths ſtraite.</hi> That which <hi>Malachy</hi> foretold of <hi>Iohn,</hi> is done: he comes according to the Prophecie, and fulfills what God intended hee ſhould doe, and what he was ſent for to doe.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Simile.</note>Kings when they goe to any place, ſend meſſengers and harbingers before them, to make all things ready for their entertaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment when they come. Now Chriſt is a great King,<note place="margin">Chriſt is at King ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally.</note> not temporally to be conſidered, but he is a ſpirituall King, and rules in the
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:4399:20"/>
hearts of all thoſe that belong to his electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of grace: and for his enemies, if they will not bee ruled by his golden rod, with his iron rod hee will breake them in pieces. Now as with great Kings there muſt bee a preparation that all things may bee ready to receive them, ſo it muſt be with our Saviour Chriſt: he never commeth into the ſoule of any unawares, or on the ſudden, but he ſends his meſſengers before him, his Miniſters to prepare them for the receiving of him, to humble mens ſoules, to make mountaines low, to make crooked things ſtraite, to pull downe every thing that exalts it ſelfe againſt God: and when the heart is thus fitted and prepared, then Chriſt ſends his Spirit to take poſſeſſion of it, and rule in it, and be a dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of it in the way of life and happineſſe.<note place="margin">And the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration for him is ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall.</note> That this preparation is ſpiritually to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, is cleere, <hi>Mat.</hi> 3.12. <hi>In thoſe dayes</hi> (ſaith the Text) <hi>came Iohn preaching, and ſaying, Repent yee, for the kingdome of God is at hand.</hi> Here <hi>Iohn</hi> proclaimeth the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of Chriſt, and laboureth to prepare all things fitting for him: ſo then the heart of a poore ſinner, is the high-way wherein Chriſt walketh. This way of it ſelfe is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitting for Chriſt, but this preaching of the Goſpell doth fit and prepare it, and then the Lord Chriſt commeth, and takes poſſeſſion of, and ruleth in that ſoule to whom hee
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:4399:21"/>
commeth. In the materiall Temple, when it was to be built, there was a <hi>caveat</hi> given, that there muſt be no hammer heard, but that all the ſtones ſhould be fitted and hewen, ere they were brought thither. When Chriſt came into his Temple hee found money changers,<note place="margin">John 2.15.</note> and the Text ſaith, hee made a whip, and whipped them out, and flung downe their proviſion. As it was with the materiall Temple, ſo it is with the ſpirituall Temple. The ſoule of a poore ſinner is like unto this materiall Temple, whereof this was a type:<note place="margin">1 Cor. 3.16.</note> for, ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>You are the Temple of the living God:</hi> You are that which the Temple ſignified, that is, as God did ſhew himſelfe marvellouſly in his Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, ſo he will in the ſoules of his people; he will dwell with them, and aſſiſt them in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry good worke. Now before we can bee fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to be the Temple of the Lord, before Chriſt will come into our ſoules, hee will whip out all diſtempered affections; and when theſe are removed, hee will make him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe knowne to be the King of his ſervants, and provide all things for their comfort and conſolation.</p>
               <p>And thus wee ſee the truth of the point, that the ſoule of a ſinner muſt bee prepared for Chriſt, before it can receive and enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine him.</p>
               <p>For the opening of the point two things
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:4399:21"/>
muſt be conſidered: firſt, how we may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive and underſtand the compaſſe of this preparation, that wee may ſee how farre it reacheth, and know wherein this preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the ſoule diſcovereth it ſelfe; and then, ſecondly, we muſt know the reaſon why the heart muſt be prepared for the Lord Ieſus, before hee will take poſſeſſion of it. And when theſe two things be opened, the point will be plaine.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, wee muſt ſee the compaſſe of this preparation, and wherein it conſiſts;<note place="margin">Preparation of the heart for Chriſt ſtandeth in three things.</note> which makes it ſelfe knowne in three particulars. We will ſpeake of preparation only in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall here; for we ſhall come to the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars of it hereafter.</p>
               <p>The firſt of the three paſſages wherein this generall preparation conſiſts, is this;<note place="margin">1. In break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing off the league with old ſinnes.</note> The ſoule of a ſinner breakes that league which ſometime it had with former luſts and corruptions: there is a ſeparation made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the ſoule and thoſe darling ſinnes which it before ſo much delighted in; and the heart begins to rebell againſt thoſe baſe tyrants which before uſurped authority o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver it, whether they be corruptions, or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits, or pleaſures, that before bore a great ſway in the ſoule, the league is broken, there is a ſecret kind of mutinie which the ſoule ſetteth up againſt thoſe diſtempers: in ſo much that the ſeparation being made, and
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:4399:22"/>
the ſoule having caſt off the yoke of her cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions, the heart reſerves it ſelfe for the Lord Chriſt Ieſus. And obſerve it, alwaies there is a ſeparation of the ſoule from ſinne, before there bee a reſervation made for Chriſt. It is with the ſoule, as it is with a wife that is an adultereſſe, and hath gotten her ſelfe a baſe name, and an evill report by her lewd and wicked courſes; after the Lord hath opened her eyes, and diſcovered to her the baſeneſſe of her practice, then ſhee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to deteſt all her former courſes, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandoneth all her former wicked compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; and though ſhee be laid at continually by them, and importuned upon every occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, yet ſhee never hearkeneth unto them, but looketh onely unto her husband: and if he will but receive her, and entertaine her a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, then ſhee will keepe cloſe unto him, and ſhew more love unto him than ever ſhee did before: ſo the ſoule of a poore ſinner was created for God, and it ought to have beene married to God: the end of our crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and redemption was, that we might have communion with God; but all of us have played the adultereſſes, wee have had our wicked lovers. The heart that will have the world, the profits, and pleaſures, and vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties thereof, will be married to luſts and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions; every man doth beſtow his ſoule upon theſe wicked practices.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="37" facs="tcp:4399:22"/>But then the eyes of the ſoule are opened, when the Lord diſcovereth unto it, that looſe practices will bring the ſoule to everlaſting confuſion and deſtruction: the ſoule then doth ſtand at a maze, it trades no more with thoſe beloved luſts and corruptions, it breakes the league with all former ſinnes and diſtempers, with pride, and covetouſneſſe, with malice and envie, with the world, with the profits and pleaſures thereof, and ſits as a widow divorced from all theſe, and wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth for the Lord Chriſt Ieſus alone: then the ſoule ſaith to her ſelfe, Oh if Chriſt would come to me, and ſpeake to me againe, then I will give him better entertainment than ever I did before. The ungracious heart, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it hath gone from the Lord, yet if it hath got any hope to receive Chriſt againe, then the ſoule will ſay, I was not borne to ſinne, ſinne ſhall bee my husband no more; but if the Lord will ſhew any favour to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards mee, then I will reſerve my ſelfe for him alone: for it was better with mee for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly, than now. And this the Scripture ſpeaketh of <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 14, 3.8. ſee what the Church ſaith there in the third verſe, <hi>Aſhur ſhall not ſave us, wee will not ride upon horſes, neither will we ſay any more to the worke of our hands, Yee are our gods: for with thee the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therleſſe findeth mercy.</hi> And in the eighth verſe, <hi>Ephraim ſhall ſay, What have I to doe
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:4399:23"/>
with Idols?</hi> Every man naturally hath his gods, his god pride, his god covetouſneſſe, his god malice, his god envie: now when the ſoule is divorced from theſe, then it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turneth this anſwer, We will pray no more to our gods, we will not ſubmit our ſelves to any, as unto a god, but onely unto the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of lights. <hi>Ephraim ſhall ſay, What have I to doe with Idols?</hi> He was before addicted to Idolatry, yet now his eyes being opened, and his ſoule converted, he ſaith, <hi>What have I to doe with Idols</hi> any more? and the drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kard ſaith, What have I to doe with drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenneſſe any more? and the proud man ſaith, What have I to doe with pride any more? nay, What have I to doe with any unlawfull practice? but I will reſerve my ſelfe wholly for the Lord Ieſus Chriſt: ſo in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 45, 10, 11. there is a mariage betweene Chriſt and his Church: for the Text ſaith, <hi>Hearken (O daughter) and conſider, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline thine eare; forget alſo thy owne people, and thy fathers houſe. So ſhall the King greatly deſire thy beauty: for hee is thy Lord, and worſhip thou him.</hi> Take notice, there muſt be a forgetting of the fathers houſe; that is, of all luſts, ſinnes and corruptions, profits and pleaſures; all muſt bee forgotten and forſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken.<note place="margin">Simile.</note> A woman when ſhee is married unto a husband, muſt not thinke alwayes to bee at home, and to live in her fathers houſe: ſo
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:4399:23"/>
we, when we are married to the Lord Chriſt Ieſus, muſt leave all our darling ſinnes, and forſake all our beloved luſts, and reſerve our ſelves wholly for our husband.</p>
               <p>So that then the heart is prepared for Chriſt, when all is laid aſide, when all former wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked courſes are forgotten, ſo farre as to love them, as to remember to hate them, that ſo the ſoule may be ready, and the heart fitted to receive and entertaine Chriſt Ieſus when he commeth. And this is the rule which Chriſt himſelfe giveth to any which will be his Diſciple. <hi>Mat.</hi> 10.37. <hi>He that loveth father or mother more than me, is not worthy of me:</hi> that is, he is not fitted and prepared to receive me. He that is not content to part with all profits, pleaſures, and delights, for the Lords ſake, he is not fit to receive the Lord Ieſus Chriſt: that ſoule is not yet prepared to entertaine him, and to give any welcome to him. So that this is the firſt paſſage; there muſt bee nothing betweene Chriſt and the ſoule, hee muſt lie next the heart: as there muſt none lie in the Privie Chamber but the King, ſo there muſt nothing but Chriſt lie next the heart.</p>
               <p>The ſecond thing wherein this preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on diſcovers it ſelfe, is this,<note place="margin">2. In giving way to Jeſus Chriſt.</note> As the ſoule muſt reſerve itſelfe onely for Chriſt, ſo the ſoule in the ſecond place muſt be willing to give way to Chriſt Ieſus. For howſoever the
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:4399:24"/>
ſoule in the very point and inſtant of prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration hath no more power, or grace, or ſtrength, to get dominion over ſin than it had before, yet it is willingly content that Ieſus Chriſt ſhould come into it, and overthrow all that oppoſeth him: it is content to joyne ſides with Chriſt, it goeth along with him: it is content that Chriſt ſhould do what plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth him in the ſoule; if there be any corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that the ſoule cannot get maſtery of, it wiſheth, Oh that Chriſt would come and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moove this corruption. Thus the ſoule is content to have Chriſt make havock of all, and ſet up his kingdome in it, and doe what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever pleaſeth him.</p>
               <p>The ſoule that is prepared for Chriſt, how ſoever it hath not grace, and power, and ſtrength, in the particular moment of prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration: though it hath not attained that pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to kill and crucifie all corruptions, yet it is willingly content that Chriſt ſhould come and take all the keyes of the houſe; it is wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to open the gates of the City unto him, and let him doe what hee will therein: it is content that the Lord Ieſus ſhould every way overthrow the power that comes againſt him, and diſpoſe of all things to his owne glory and honour. In <hi>Eſay</hi> 26.13. There is a pretty paſſage: ſaith the Text, <hi>Other Lords beſides thee have had dominion over us: but by thee onely will we make mention of thy Name.</hi> The
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:4399:24"/>
people of the Iewes here would not beare the Lords yoke, and therefore they had hard taskmaſters: and when they ſaw enemies on the one ſide, and enemies on the other, then they complained, Many vexations have we found at the hands of unreaſonable ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants, but now we wil remember thy Name onely; that is, if our God will now come and rule over us, wee would rebell againſt our other lords, and let God be Lord onely over us, and doe what he will unto us. In 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 10.3.4. when <hi>Iehu</hi> had overcome two Kings, he ſendeth meſſengers to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Iſrael to chooſe a King, and ſet him up over them. But (ſaith the Text) <hi>behold two Kings ſtood not before him: how then ſhall wee ſtand?</hi> But in the fifth verſe they ſent word unto <hi>Iehu,</hi> and ſayd, <hi>We are thy ſervants, and will doe what thou wouldſt have us to doe, we wil not not make any King: doe what is good in thine own eyes,</hi> This is the frame of the heart prepared for the Lord Ieſus. When Chriſt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth againſt a ſoule, and ſaith, You have ſet up your corruptions to be your gods, you have caſt away my Commandements, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend therefore your ſelves, and know that God is angry with you, and I am comming a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt you to take vengeance, if the ſoule now ſubmits it ſelfe, and ſaith, Lord do what thou wilt, and what is good in thine owne eyes, our humors ſhall not be followed any more
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:4399:25"/>
we will not follow our owne minds and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, but we will doe what thou com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeſt us: doe Lord even what is good in thine eyes: if a ſoule bee thus diſpoſed, then it is prepared for the Lord Ieſus. The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digall ſon, <hi>Luke</hi> 15. when hee ſaw that po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty pinched him, and that he muſt come home by weeping croſſe, when by wofull experience hee ſaw that want befell him, and that famine came cloſe unto him, then hee confeſſed, What a wretch am I? there are they in my fathers houſe, yea the ſervants, there have bread enough; but I ſtarve here for hunger: upon this he reſolves to goe to his father, he doth not ſtand vpon termes with him, and ſay, I will be ſo and ſo advanced; but he ſaith,<note place="margin">Luk. 15.18.19</note> 
                  <hi>Father, I have ſinned againſt heaven and againſt thee, &amp; am no more worthy to be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led thy ſon, make me as one of thy hired ſervants.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now if hee can come within his fathers doores, he cares not; hee will ſtoope and bee conformable in every caſe. So it is with the ſoule prepared for <hi>Chriſt:</hi> thoſe that have ſtubborne hearts, they will not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey the Lord, but they will be gone, as the prodigall ſonne did; yet they will one day bee found when miſery hath ſeized upon their ſoules, and then they will ſay, Oh happy are thoſe that live under the miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the Word: If the Lord would but once receive mee to mercy againe, then I
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:4399:25"/>
would obey every command, and ſtoope to every word of the Lord, then I would wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly give place ever to the Lord.</p>
               <p>And this is the ſecond thing, wherein this preparation manifeſts it ſelfe; when the ſoule of a poore ſinner is willing thus to give way to Chriſt, and to let him take poſſeſſion of it, to overthrow whatſoever hindereth and oppoſeth him, and to diſpoſe of all things to his owne good pleaſure.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">3. In giving up all the roome unto Chriſt.</note> when the ſoule doth rebell a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt her former ſinnes, and is reſerved only for Chriſt, and is content thus to receive God, and is willing that Chriſt ſhould over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw whatſoever oppoſeth him, and doe whatſoever pleaſeth him, then in the third place this is only obſervable, the manner how the ſoule prepared giveth way unto God. It gives the Lord way in the whole a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie of it, that God in all things may rule in it: it doth not give God place in ſome things onely, and ſay, God ſhall rule in mine eye, but not in my hand; God ſhall rule in my hand, but not in my tongue; God ſhall rule in my tongue, but not in my heart: but the ſoule giveth way to Chriſt in all things whatſoever.<note place="margin">Simile.</note> A great man that is to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine his Prince and Soveraigne, doth not put him into a corner of his houſe, but hee giveth him all the roome, and ſhifts out all his ſervants, and puts out every one, both
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:4399:26"/>
friend and foe: every place he ſheweth him, and giveth him all the keyes, and lets him diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of all things. So a ſoule that is prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for the Lord Ieſus, doth not crowd him into a corner, and ſay, I muſt have one cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner for a covetous heart, another corner for a proud heart: no, no, but a prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red heart giveth up all to God, it reſerveth no privie corner in this kind, but ability, fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, and whatſoever it is, the ſoule giveth up all to God, that he may diſpoſe of all. A ſinfull ſoule that is prepared, is not perfectly able of it ſelfe thus to over-rule his heart: but, as it is with a man, when he gives up his houſe for the entertainment of the King, doe what he can there will be ſome baſe fellowes peeping in; but he is not pleaſed with it, it is againſt his mind that they ſhould ſo doe, and he would with all his heart have his Majeſty uſe ſome meanes for the reſtraining of them: ſo it is with a ſoule prepared for the Lord, it reſignes all unto him, hand, eye, and tongue, and heart, and practice; but yet there will bee ſome baſe luſts and ſinfull corruptions, there will be hypocriſie, and pride, and ſelfe-love, peeping into his heart: but it is againſt the mind of a prepared ſinner, it is his mind that God ſhould root out all thoſe, and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der all to his owne glory.</p>
               <p>And this is the third paſſage: ſo that the ſoule which hath broken the league with all
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:4399:26"/>
corruptions, and reſerveth it ſelfe for Chriſt; the ſoule that is willing to give way to Chriſt and let him overthrow all whatſoever oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth him, and do whatſoever pleaſeth him; that ſoule I ſay which doth not thruſt Chriſt into a corner, but gives up all unto him, that ſoule is prepared for the Lord Ieſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>The next thing to be conſidered for the opening of the point,<note place="margin">2. Reaſon why the heart muſt be ſo prepared for Chriſt.</note> is the reaſon why Chriſt requires this preparation of the heart: and this will cut the throat of abundance of carnall conceits and imaginations. Men thinke that Chriſt will come ſuddenly from heaven into their hearts, at a beck; they think that, Lord have mercy upon me, will fecth him. No, no, Chriſt will have the ſoule pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared before he wil come &amp; take poſſeſſion of it; and the reaſon is, becauſe it cannot ſtand with the all-ſoveraigne holineſſe of Chriſt to come there. It's ſo in common ſenſe, there cannot be two Kings in one Throne,<note place="margin">Non capit regnum duos.</note> there cannot be two Suns in one Firmament, there cannot be two Gods in one heart, we cannot ſerve God and Mammon. Some would have their ſoules divided; and have God to be King, and raigne therein to day, and their ſinnes and luſts to morrow; or elſe they will have Chriſt raigne in one corner of their hearts, and their ſinnes and luſts in another: but God will have all, or none at all, in this caſe either no God, or one God in thy heart.

Our Saviour Chriſt, <hi>Math.</hi> 12.29. diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth, <hi>How can one enter into a ſtrong mans houſe, and ſpoile his goods, unleſſe he firſt bind the ſtrong man, and then ſpoile his goods?</hi> The ſtrong man is ſinne and Satan, and the houſe is the heart; now Chriſt cannot goe into the heart, and exerciſe authority there, untill he hath wrought a ſeparation betweene the ſoule and theſe, and hath throwne out this god, and then the God of heaven and earth takes poſſeſſion of the heart. Firſt ſin and Satan muſt be throwne out of the ſoule, before the Lord will take poſſeſſion. He that takes poſſeſſion of a houſe, if there bee any in the houſe beſides himſelfe, it is not good in law: if there be any take poſſeſſion of the heart, and beare ſway there, Chriſt will beare no rule: for it cannot ſtand with the holineſſe of Chriſt to have any competitor, to have another beare rule with himſelfe: and Chriſt himſelfe plainly determines this, <hi>Matth.</hi> 6.24. <hi>Yee cannot ſerve God and Mammon.</hi> You thinke you may have the Divell rule in you one fit, and God ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; but <hi>you cannot ſerve God and Mammon:</hi> one Maſter muſt be renounced, before ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can be received.

                  <note place="margin">Thoſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved, who thinke to have mercy and heaven all on the ſudden.</note> The truth being granted, and the doctrine clee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, the firſt Uſe is a Uſe of reproofe. Wee may here diſcover, and alſo condemne the fond dreames, and vaine imaginations of many poore, ſinfull, ignorant creatures, who have invented a new way, a backe doore to carry themſelves to heaven, more than ever the Word revealed, and it is this; Men thinke that they may have Chriſt, and mercy at command, and that they may catch at, and obtaine bleſſedneſſe and happineſſe at una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wares, and on the ſudden, and yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding live in ſinne, and continue in ſinne, and approve of ſinne, and addict themſelves thereunto; and then when ſickneſſe comes, if they can but ſay, Lord have mercy on me, they muſt goe to heaven all on the ſudden. Be perſwaded at length to ſee the folly and ſottiſhneſſe of this conceit: this is not the way which the Word reveales Chriſt by, it makes no ſuch agreement with us; unleſſe a poore ſinner thinke that Chriſt will carry him to heaven with his uncleanneſſe and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bominable ſinnes, when as he hath ſaid, that no uncleane thing ſhall enter into the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of heaven.</p>
               <p>No, no, if the harbenger goeth not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, the King will not come: where there
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:4399:28"/>
goeth no preparation before, there can bee no receiving of Chriſt. He that will receive Chriſt, and benefit by him, and comfort and ſalvation from him, muſt receive him at thoſe termes wherupon he hath offered him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, or elſe he ſhall never receive him. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.17. the text there ſaith, <hi>Come out from among them, and bee ſeparate, ſaith the Lord, and touch no uncleane thing, and I will receive you.</hi> Marke here the agreement that God maketh: thou muſt firſt come out from among them, yea, come out from thy ſinnes; thou muſt come out of thy luſts and corruptions, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord will come in. Can any man put good gold into a purſe that is filled with ſtones before? can the ſoule of a ſinner enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine Chriſt Ieſus when it is full of luſts, and they doe altogether poſſeſſe it? No, no, <hi>Come out,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>and touch no uncleane thing;</hi> that is, bee not married unto it, (for that is the meaning of the words:) let thy affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, be removed from all luſts and corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and then I will come and dwell with thee, and walke with thee; that is, I will bountifully provide for thee, for the conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of thy ſoule here and hereafter. It was the order of God, <hi>Luke</hi> 3.5. when <hi>Iohn</hi> the Baptiſt was to make way for Chriſt: marke here how he was levelling and undermining, <hi>Every mountaine and hill ſhall bee brought low, every valley ſhall be filled, and the rough
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:4399:28"/>
wayes made plaine, and the crooked things ſtraite: And then all fleſh ſhall ſee the ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the Lord.</hi> If you will have a moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine before your ſalvation, or goe into a ditch, you ſhall never ſee ſalvation ſoundly and ſurely: but if you purpoſe to ſee ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, downe with thoſe mountaines of pride; you muſt lay them flat to the ground, you muſt be teachable, ſtoope, and bee confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable; you muſt not lift up your ſelves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Chriſt, you muſt not walke in your owne wayes. No, no, downe with thoſe mountaines, downe with thoſe ſtubborne and diſobedient hearts: for you ſhall never ſee ſalvation as long as theſe mountaines re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine; but your ſoules muſt be made pliable to Chriſt, and then you ſhall ſee the day of comfort approaching, and drawing nigh unto you. Doe you thinke it is fit if a man were to entertaine the King, to put his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants in the chiefe roome, and afford the King ſome out-roomes only, and let him bee as a ſervant to his ſervants? What a baſe and abſurd thing is this, that Chriſt ſhould come into thy ſoule to be a ſervant, as it were, to thy baſe luſts? They that have made their baſe, lewd, and wicked courſes, their gods, one man in one kind, and another in another kind, let them as they love their owne ſoules, bee perſwaded to conſider of this. They that have thus ſet up any thing above
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:4399:29"/>
God, and before him, when God at the great and dreadfull day of judgement ſhall come in flames of fire (as the Apoſtle hath it, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1.8.) to take account of them, whom they have ſerved; God will then ſend you home to your gods: hee will ſay, Goe to your gods that you have ſerved, the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell and ſinne, and not mee; you have caſt off my yoke, you have broken my law, and tranſgreſſed my ſtatutes: goe then to your luſts and your ſinnes you have ſo much hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted after, let them ſave you now, and ſhew mercie towards you; for they were your gods, and they ſhall ſave you if ever you have ſalvation. Thinke of this, and bee throughly perſwaded of this, and cut off that ſinfull conceit, that Chriſt and corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion will ſtand together, and come on the ſudden with one word ſpeaking: thinke not if you can ſay, Lord have mercy upon me, and receive the Sacrament from the hand of ſome factious Miniſter, then Chriſt will preſently come to your hearts. No, no, you muſt have your hearts prepared, before Chriſt Ieſus will come into your ſoules: the the heart muſt bee broken, and the ſoule ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered from ſinne and corruption, before Chriſt will come and take poſſeſſion of it.

But mark what we may conclude: here the condition of the man is marvellous miſerable that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver had his heart prepared, never humbled, never changed, never fitted for the Lord Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus: for Chriſt will never come into that ſoule that is moſt certaine. You that content your ſelves with this, I never knew what it was to be humbled: the preciſe Miniſters indeed talke of preparation, but I never knew what it meant: Oh poore creatures, they know now not what belongs to the Miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of God in this kind, but in the meane time be ſure of this, that if thou haſt not the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, thou canſt not expect the latter: if thy heart be not prepared for Chriſt, there can be no receiuing of Chriſt. <hi>Salvation is farre from the wicked, becauſe they keepe not thy lawes,</hi> ſaith the Prophet <hi>David,</hi> Thou that haſt no care to walke with God, doſt thou dreame of ſalvation?

habitation, thou art not prepared to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine the Lord Ieſus, and therfore thou canſt not expect Chriſt and ſalvation by him. Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peale to your owne conſciences in this kind; If a man ſhould goe to a great houſe, and ſee the beſt part of it ſtuffed with ordinary commodities, and a great deale of it with baſe baggage and filthy traſh, he wil preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conclude, the King will not come heere: and why? becauſe there is no preparation for him, there is therefore no expectation of his Maieſty in this place. And it is a good ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, when a man ſhall ſee the hearts and lives of men ſtuffed not onely with a great deale of ordinary traſh, but full of worldly affections, full of the world in their hearts, lives, and converſations: yea, when a man ſhall ſee every place full in this kind: as when the whole man is full of ſin, and of baſe cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions, will any thinke that this man ſhall be ſaved? Can any man in common ſenſe imagine that Chriſt wil come; into that mans ſoule where there is no preparation for him? Mountains muſt be levelled, crooked things made ſtraight, and the rough wayes made ſmooth, and all to make way for Chriſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hee will come: and therefore ſurely where there is no fitting of the heart this way, there is no hope, no expectation, that Chriſt Ieſus will come in thither. Men pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare for the world continually, and prepare
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:4399:30"/>
onely how they may may ſhut out Chriſt Ieſus. One man prepares honours, and his perſon, that muſt have preferment, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther man provides for his eaſe, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he will make any ſhift, that he may not endanger himſelf, he will be content to make any ſhew of reaſon, rather than he will come into office whereby his eaſe may be hindred: another man will provide for his family, that that may be comforted and ſuſtained; and though religion and a good conſcience bee ſhaken, he cares not, he muſt make preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for the maintenance of his family, oh what will become of that! Hee cares not what become of Chriſt: though the word be oppoſed, though he takes rebellious cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and throwes out Chriſt, he cares not. Is this to make preparation for Chriſt, or to make oppoſition againſt Chriſt? Nay, when men come to faires and markets, oh what preparation is there then for covetouſneſſe on every ſide! Some prepare falſe weights, others falſe meaſures. The ſeller ſaith, It is exceeding good, when it is ſtarke naught. The buyer ſaith, It is naught, it is naught, when it is good: and ſo both diſhonour God Nay, (which is moſt lamentable) men pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare for drunkenneſſe: Oh, ſay they, at ſuch a faire we will be merry: then every Ale-houſe is full of bad company: they reſolue to ſit at the pot from morning till night,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:4399:31"/>
untill they goe reeling about the ſtreets. There is great preparation in this kind: Nay men will remove ſome ſins, that others may come in their roomes, and they wil perform ſome good duties, to make them free for ſin: this is a very cunning tricke. You ſhall ſee a man that will read, and pray and heare Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, and make a great profeſſion; and what is his purpoſe herein? namely, that he may have praiſe or profit thereby, that he may get the better cuſtome to his ſhop, that hee may cheat without controlment, that he may couſen without diviſion or diſtracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. I beſeech you thinke of theſe things: If it bee ſo that Chriſt muſt be thus prepared for before he will come, then examine your owne ſoules, and reaſon with your ſelves thus, what have I done? have I ſold, my ſoule to doe evill? I have dreamed that I might have Chriſt at a becke; and not bee prepared for him. and therefore it is I that have not received him. Will any man ſow his ſeed before the ground be plowed? Will any man build before the foundation bee laid? Doe we thinke that the Lord wil reare up the building of grace in our hearts before the foundation be laid?

If the ſoule bee but broken and humbled, he will come preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and not breake an haire with you. True<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly this preparation is the very entrance into
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:4399:32"/>
ſalvation: and therefore take notice of it. Men are loath to leave all for Chriſt in this caſe, they are loath to loſe their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits and pleaſures, their luſts and corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: they are like Inne-keepers, they are loath to thruſt their profitable gueſts out of their houſes, they would bee loath to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der themſelves that way, yea and though the King were to come thither, they would ſecretly wiſh that his Maieſty would turne another way: ſo it is a hard matter for men to diſ-lodge all profits and pleaſures, and to vomit up thoſe ſweet morſels and beloved corruptions, that Chriſt might come into their ſoules. Some poore ſoule may ſpeak to me as the Devill did to Chriſt, Why art <hi>thou come to torment mee before my time?</hi> ſo many men will be ready to ſay, Why doth the Lord Ieſus come to torment us before our times? What, muſt we now abandon all our profits and pleaſures if we will receive Chriſt? They could ſecretly wiſh that Chriſt would goe another way, It is a very hard thing to bring the ſoule thus to be divorced from corruptions: it is very hard when a man muſt give a bill of divorcement, and never ſee the face of his corruptions more this is very hard with a poore ſinner.<note place="margin">Motives to prepare for Chriſt.</note>

who we are that muſt receive Chriſt: ſecondly, who Chriſt is that is to be received.</p>
               <p>Firſt, let us conſider our ſelves,<note place="margin">1.

Conſider this, and thinke with thy ſelfe, Will the Lord of heaven come downe? Will Chriſt dwell in my heart? Will hee vouchſafe to looke in, yea, to call as hee goeth by the ſoule of mee ſuch a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full creature? And let this move thee to prepare for his comming. If a King will but call at a poore mans window as he rideth by, hee will count it a great favour: much more it is for the great God of heaven and earth but to looke in, and reveale himſelfe unto the heart of a poore ſinfull creature. Wee are not worthy that the Lord ſhould come under our roofe. 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 8.27. there <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> ſaith, <hi>Will God indeed dwell on the earth?</hi> will he dwell in a houſe made with hands? As if he ſhould ſay, Is it poſſible? can it bee imagined, that thou Lord being the great God of heaven, whom the <hi>heaven of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens cannot containe,</hi> ſhouldſt once vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafe to dwell in a houſe made with hands, in the Temple which I have builded? And what may we ſay? Is it ſo? can it be, ſhall it be, that God will come and dwell under our roofe? that hee will come and dwell in our rotten and ſinfull hearts? that hee will

dwell in our wretched and ſinfull ſoules? Why he will, he hath ſaid it, he hath promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed it, he will performe it: and therefore let us conſider our owne unworthineſſe to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive Chriſt, as a motive to ſtirre us up to make preparation for him. For the baſer the place is that ſhould entertaine him, the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the preparation ought to be. Wee ought to wonder that the Lord will vouchſafe to come into our ſinfull ſoules, and therefore we had need to prepare the more for his comming. The Lord hath promiſed to come into our ſoules if wee humble them, and make them fitting to receive his Majeſty: and therefore ſweep your hearts, and clenſe thoſe roomes, clenſe every ſinke, bruſh downe every cobweb, and make roome for Chriſt: for if thy heart bee prepard, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorced from all corruptions, then Chriſt will come into thy ſoule, and take poſſeſſion of it. Remove therefore all corruptions out of thy heart. And when thou haſt ſwept e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very corner of thy houſe, doe not leave the duſt behind the doore, for that is a fluts tricke: doe not remove ſinne out of thy tongue, and out of thy eye, and out of thy hand, and leave it in thy heart.

Therefore doe all that poſſibly may be done, to prepare for his comming, and for the entertainement and welcomming of him when he comes. In <hi>Pſal.</hi> 24.7. <hi>David</hi> calleth upon his owne ſoule, and other of Gods people (for ſo the words are to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded:) there he ſaith, <hi>Lift up your heads, O yee Gates, and be yee lift up yee everlaſting doores: and the King of glory ſhall come in.</hi> As who ſhould ſay, Be enlarged, love, joy, hope, ſet open, give way, for the Lord is comming.

<pb n="63" facs="tcp:4399:35"/>
and now laboureth to doe good unto you? Would not this move you to prepare your your hearts for him, and to let him in? Nay, marke what Chriſt ſaith to the Church, <hi>Cant.</hi> 5.2. <hi>Open to me, my ſiſter, my love, my dove, my undefiled: for my head is filled with dew, and my lockes with the drops of the night.</hi> As if hee ſhould ſay, I have had an ill journey, a bad way, and unkind entertainment, and therefore come away <hi>my love, my dove, my undefiled, and open unto me.</hi> So hee ſaith to every one of our ſoules, This day I have travelled a great way for you, and have had a very hard journey; I have ſuffered many croſſes and afflictions, many mockes and ſcoffes; many buffets, yea, even death it ſelfe, for you: will you now ſuffer the Lord Ieſus, wearied and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexed, to ſtand knocking and calling, and weeping, and ſaying as he ſaid to Ieruſalem, <hi>Luke</hi> 19.42. <hi>Oh that thou hadſt knowne, even thou at leaſt in this thy day, the things belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to thy peace: but now they are hid from thine eyes?</hi> Will you ſuffer Chriſt in this plight, thus ſaying unto you, as hee did to Ieruſalem, to ſtand knocking at the doore of your hearts, and your ſoules?</p>
               <p>Take heed of this, Chriſt knocketh this day at your hearts; if you now give him his laſt anſwer, and ſhut the doore againſt him, it may prove to bee the laſt knocking, you
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:4399:36"/>
may hap never to ſee him more. The Church in the place before named, <hi>Cant.</hi> 5. <hi>ver.</hi> 3. ſhifted off Chriſt, and would not let him in when ſhe heard him knocke: <hi>I have put off my coate, how ſhall I put it on? I have waſhed my feet, how ſhall I defile them?</hi> But after <hi>ſhee roſe to open to her beloved, and her hands dropped myrrhe, and her fingers ſweet ſmel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling myrrhe, upon the handles of the locke, ver</hi> 5. And then ſhe <hi>opened to her beloved, but he had withdrawne himſelfe, and was gone:</hi> and then ſhee ſought him with many trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles and knockes before ſhe found him: <hi>The watchmen found her, and wounded her, the keepers of the walls tooke her vaile from her.</hi> If you put of Chriſt, and give him delayes when he knocks at the doores of your hearts, then perhaps hee may never knocke more, and then you may ſeeke him, and deſire him earneſtly, and perhaps never find him more, or receive comfort from him, and ſalvation by him. Oh therefore take heed how you drive away your crucified Saviour; but even now make all preparations for his entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and for receiving of him, that you may receive everlaſting life, and ſalvation from him. In <hi>Ier.</hi> 2.12. the Prophet ſaith, <hi>Be aſtoniſhed, O yee heavens, be yee horribly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid, be yee deſolate, ſaith the Lord.</hi> What is the reaſon of this? It is in the 11. and 13. verſes: The Heathen have not <hi>changed their
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:4399:36"/>
gods, which are no gods, but my people have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken me, the fountain of living waters, &amp; hew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en out to themſelves ciſternes even broken ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterns that can hold no water: they have changed their glory for that which profiteth not. Be aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed at this, O yee heavens.</hi> Turkes have their gods, and Infidels have their gods, and what care have they to obey them, when as yet their gods are no gods? And ſhall a Chriſtian have a Saviour to ſave him, and to redeeme him, and ſhew mercy upon him, and then ſhut him out in this kind? Remember what the Prophet <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 132.4, 5. <hi>I will give no ſleepe to mine eyes, nor ſlumber to mine eye-lids, untill I have prepared a place, an ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation for the God of Iacob:</hi> and if hee had ſaid, I have houſes, and I have palaces, and Gods honour lieth in the duſt; no more ſleepe, no more reſt, no more content, untill I have prepared <hi>an habitation for the God of Iacob.</hi> What <hi>David</hi> did, that doe you. There is no materiall Temple to bee prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; but we are the Temple, and the Church of God, prepare therefore an habitation, an heart for the Lord Ieſus Chriſt. And every ſoule that hath heretofore caſt out the Lord Ieſus Chriſt, and given him no entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, let him now reſolve to doe it, and let every one ſay to their husbands and friends, We have this, and wee have that, this bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, that benefit: but the Lord hath come
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:4399:37"/>
often and asked a roome for himſelfe: O let us not ſleepe, nor give reſt unto our hearts, nor contentation to our ſoules, untill wee have prepared an habitation, untill wee have prepared an heart fit for the entertainment of the mighty God of Iacob. If thou doſt not now prepare for him as a Saviour to ſave thee hereafter, thou muſt receive him as a Iudge to condemne thee: and therefore de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay no longer, but every night, and every morning call upon one another to prepare for the Lord Ieſus.</p>

               <p>In <hi>Hoſea</hi> 6.5. it is a phraſe wee ſhall meet withall: for there the Text ſaith, <hi>I have hewen them by my Prophets.</hi> The Church is compared to a Vineyard, the godly to the Branches, the Word to the pruning and cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of theſe Branches. As it was with the building of the materiall Temple of <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi> there were many ſturdy Oakes and tall Cedars that were to be hewen and faſhioned before they would be fit for the building: ſo it muſt bee here with the trees of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, our ſinfull ſoules: ſome of us have ſturdy hearts like Oakes, and ſome have proud and lofty hearts like the <hi>tall Cedars of Lebanon:</hi> theſe ſtout hearts and lofty ſpirits muſt bee cut downe by the axe of Gods word, and levelled and fitted to lay hold up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and bee ſettled unto the Lord Ieſus Chriſt. Every mans ſoule, eſpecially thoſe ſoules that belong to the election of grace, are ground that muſt be tilled and plowed by the word of God; their fallow grounds
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:4399:39"/>
muſt be broken up, before any ſeed of grace can be caſt into their ſoules. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3 9. there the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>You are Gods husbandrie;</hi> and therefore God by his word muſt plow up the weeds of ſinne and corruption which are in you, before he can ſow the graces of his holy Spirit in your hearts. And that place, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.37. will make the Doctrine cleere and evident: Saint <hi>Peter</hi> was a man of a ſtout and courageous ſpirit, and hee ſpake home unto the Iewes, hee tells them that <hi>God hath made that Ieſus, whom they crucified, the Lord and Chriſt.</hi> And <hi>when they heard theſe things</hi> (ſaith the Text) that is, the word powerfully delivered and brought home to their ſoules, <hi>they were pricked in their hearts, and ſaid, Men and brethren, what ſhall we doe?</hi> Now they were prepared in ſome meaſure to ſeeke after ſalvation.</p>
               <p>For the better underſtanding of this point, two things are to be conſidered: firſt, what a powerfull miniſterie is, and wherein the power and efficacie of it conſiſts: ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, how this powerfull miniſterie doth worke upon the ſoule to prepare it for Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Firſt, what is this powerfull miniſtery?<note place="margin">1. A powerfull Miniſtery conſiſteth in 3. things.</note> wherein doth the power of the miniſterie, and of <hi>Elias</hi> conſiſt? It is diſcovered in three particulars:</p>

truth to the ſoules of men, with courage.

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſtery. 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 18.21. there the miniſtery of <hi>Elias</hi> is mentioned: for the Text ſaith, <hi>Elias came unto all the people, and ſaid, How long halt ye betweene two opinions? If the Lord be God, follow him; but if Baal be God, follow him.</hi> It was in a time when peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple had departed from the Lord. <hi>Elias</hi> at this time did not come to one man alone in a corner, and ſay, You ſhould doe well to conſider of the caſe, how it ſtands; it is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry deſperate, I would wiſh you to returne unto the Lord, it will be your beſt courſe: hee doth not doe thus, but he <hi>came to all the people:</hi> and marke how hee ſpeakes, <hi>If Baal be God, follow him; if the Lord be God, follow him.</hi> Away with this halting: what? nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hot nor cold? A man cannot tell where to have you: intend one thing or other: <hi>if Baal be God,</hi> why ſo <hi>if the Lord bee God,</hi> ſo: make ſomething of it in this caſe: thus <hi>hee ſpake to all the people,</hi> ſaith the Text. And we ſhall obſerve the ſame in <hi>Iohn</hi> Baptiſt, that had <hi>the power and ſpirit of Elias, Matth.</hi> 3.7. hee did not goe there behind the doore to ſpeake, but hee ſpake to the Phariſees and Sadduces after this manner, <hi>O yee generation
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:4399:40"/>
of vipers, who hath forewarned you to flee from the wrath to come?</hi> As if he had ſaid, You are they that oppoſed Chriſt, and ſet your ſelues againſt the Goſpell, you have hardned your hearts, you will not enter into heaven your ſelues, not ſuffer others to enter in. Why <hi>who hath forewarned you to flee from the wrath to come?</hi> Neither is this a ſtrange courſe or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable: for our Saviour Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe uſeth it, in <hi>Mat,</hi> 23.23. from thence to the end of the chapter, the phraſe goes thus, <hi>Woe unto you Scribes, and Phariſees, Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites.</hi> Our Saviour Chriſt hath given us this patterne. The explication of the point is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but the drawing out of a ſword: and the particular application of it to the hearts of the people is like the ſtriking of the blow. The word is compared to a ſword: as, if a man ſhould draw a ſword and flouriſh it about, and ſhould not ſtrike a blow with it, it will doe no harme: even ſo it is here with the Miniſters, little good will they doe if they doe onely explicate, if they doe onely draw out the ſword of the Spirit: for unleſſe they apply it unto the peoples hearts particularly, little good may the people expect, little good ſhall the Miniſter doe. A common kind of teaching when the Miniſter doth ſpeake onely hove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringly, and in the generall, and never applies the word of God particularly, may be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:4399:41"/>
to the confuſed noiſe that was in the ſhip wherin <hi>Ionah</hi> was, when the winds blew, and the ſea raged, and a great ſtorme began to ariſe. The poore Marriners ſtrove with might and maine, and they did ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour by all meanes poſſible to bring the ſhip to the ſhore: every one cried unto his god, and caſt their wares in to the ſea, and all this while <hi>Ionas</hi> was faſt aſleepe in the ſhip, but when the Marriners came down, and plucked him up, and ſaid <hi>Ariſe thou ſleeper,</hi> and asked him, Who art thou? whence art thou? what is thy name? <hi>call upon thy God, leſt we periſh.</hi> When they thus behaved themſelues toward <hi>Ionah,</hi> then he was awakened and rowſed out of his ſleepe. The common delivery of the word is like that confuſed noiſe: there is matter of heaven, of hell, of grace, of ſin ſpoken of, there is a common noiſe, and all this while men ſit and ſleep careleſly, and never looke about them, but reſt ſecure: but when particular application comes, that ſhakes a ſinner, as the Pilot did <hi>Ionah,</hi> and askes him, What aſſurance of Gods mercy haſt thou? what hope of pardon of ſinnes, of life, and happineſſe hereafter? You are baptized, and ſo were many that are in hell: you come to Church, and ſo did many that are in hell: but what is your converſation in the mean time? Is that holy in the ſight of God and man? When the Miniſters of God
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:4399:41"/>
ſhake men, and take them up on this faſhion then they begin to ſtirre up themſelues,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> and to conſider of their eſtates. This generall and common kind of teaching is like an endite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment without a name: if a man ſhould come to the aſſizes, and make a great exclamation and have no name to his enditement, alas, no man is troubled with it, no man feares it, no man ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive any puniſhment by reaſon of it. So it is with this common kind of preaching, it is an enditement without a name. We ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt none before wee particularly arraigne them before the tribunall of the Lord, and ſhew them theſe and theſe are their ſinnes, and that unleſſe they repent and forſake them, they ſhall be damned: for then this would ſtirre them up, and make them ſeeke to the Lord for mercy; this would rowſe them out of their ſecurity, and awaken them, and make them ſay as the Iewes did to <hi>Peter</hi> and the reſt of the Apoſtles, <hi>Men and bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, what ſhall wee doe to bee ſaved? Acts</hi> 2.37,</p>
               <p>The ſecond thing wherein this powerfull miniſtery diſcovereth and manifeſts it ſelfe, is, when the Miniſters of God out of ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of argument, and plaine evidence of the will of God, and the ſpirit of God, make truth knowne to the ſpirits of men: when a mans doctrine goeth ſo guarded and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:4399:42"/>
with Scripture, and ſound and plaine demonſtration of argument, that they ſtand as Mount Sion, and are undeniable. This is the ſecond thing wherein the powerfull de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livery of the Miniſtery conſiſts; and this is Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> meaning, when hee ſaith, <hi>The kingdome of God conſiſteth not in words, but in power,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.20. <hi>The kingdome of God,</hi> that is, the Goſpel of the kingdom whereby God ruleth in the hearts of his choſen. Now this conſiſteth not in words onely, nor in a company of fine gilded ſentences, where there is nothing but a jingling and a tinkling, nothing but a ſound of words; there is no kingdome all this while, no power all this while in ſuch a kind of preaching: this will not worke effectually in the hearts and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences of men. It is with this kind of prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching as it is with rotten buildings, which are all painted over, but have ſcarce a ſound beame, or any other timber to beare up the houſe: ſo it is in this caſe, all this jing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and tinkling of words may delight the eares of the hearers, but the power is wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting that ſhould drive men to a ſtand.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, a powerfull miniſtery appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth in this, when there is a kind of ſpirituall heat in the heart, when there are holy affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,<note place="margin">Si vis meflere dolendum eſt primùm ipſi tibi.</note> and the heart of the Miniſter is anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to that he communicates and delivers unto the people. Looke what thoſe truths
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:4399:42"/>
bee which he communicates to others, his owne ſoule ſhould be affected with them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and at the time of delivery of them, that ſo he may ſpeake home to the hearts of the people:<note place="margin">Mat. 12.34.</note> For <hi>out of the aboundance of the heart the mouth ſpeaketh:</hi> ſaith our Saviour. So that the foundations and pillars of a mans ſpeech are not in the tongue, but they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed out of the heart. When the ſpeech is rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed out of the ſeveral affections, we uſe to ſay, Gracious ſpeeches, mercifull ſpeeches: the meaning is, words ariſing out of grace, and words ariſing out of mercy. When the heart of a miniſter goeth home with his words, then he delivers the word powerful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and profitably to the hearers. He that mourneth for ſin when he ſpeakes of it, will make others mourne alſo: he that carries a holy indignation againſt ſinne, he ſtirs up the ſame indignation in the man that hears him, And obſerue that when a man ſpeakes from the heart, he ſpeaks to the heart: and when a man ſpeaks from the head onely, and from the teeth outward, (as wee uſe to ſay) hee ſpeakes to the eare onely, he ſpeakes to the conceit onely. We loſe the the greateſt part of our ſpeech, and the ſtrength of our ſpeech unleſſe wee ſpeake out of the aboundance of our ſoules. When a man ſpeakes againſt ſin, hee ſhould ſpeake with a holy hatred of it from his very heart. When a man ſpeakes of

the miſery of poore creatures that are in the gall of bitterneſſe, and under the power of Satan, he ſhould mourne for the judgement that God hath appointed for them: and if men would doe thus, they would make o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers mourne alſo. It was an obſervation of a holy man upon this place, We haue piped but ye haue not danced: we haue mourned, but ye haue not weeped: That he that would affect others with any thing, muſt firſt bee affected withall himſelfe, hee muſt mourne before others will ſorrow: his heart muſt be affected with the truth that he delivers to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, before he can make others to be affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with it. I compare a mans word and the delivery of it to an arrow: draw it up to the head in a bow, and then it will both carry levell, hit ſure, and faſten to the marke the word we ſpeake is the arrow, the deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of it coldly, like the ſhooting of the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row with a ſmall ſtrength; but the delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of it with true and hearty affection, is the drawing it up to the head, and then ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what will be done, then we ſhall ſhoot home into the hearts and conſciences of men, and make them at a ſtand.

                  <note place="margin">Deut. 32.2.</note> 
                  <hi>Let my doctrine drop as the dew, as the raine upon the graſſe. Moſes</hi> his doctrine is compared to dew and to raine, now if there come a great raine, and a mighty wind with it, eſpecially a whirlewind, it carrieth

all before it; ſometimes it breakes up the foundations of houſes, and ſometimes rends up trees by the roots, and overturnes all things with the violence of it. The Doctrine and truth which the Miniſters of God deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, is as the raine: now the holy affection wherewith it is delivered, is like the whirle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wind. When the truth of God is delivered with a holy violence, and hearty affection by Gods ſervants, evermore it makes way, it beats downe, and breaks all before it, it wets more and ſinkes more and farre deeper, then any kind of other teaching.</p>
               <p>So then hee particularly and ſoundly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies the word of God to mens hearts and conſciences, that evidently by Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures and ſtrong arguments convinceth o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers with an holy and hearty affection, this man performes the miniſtery of God pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfully.</p>

               <p>And firſt, this kind of preaching doth diſcover the very ſecrets of a mans ſoule, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the vileneſſe and wickednes that is in the heart: ſo that the ſoule ſeeth that it never ſaw before, and apprehendeth that which before it never conceived. The ſoule of a poore ſinner that before lay under
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:4399:44"/>
a lazie miniſterie, when it comes to be under a powerfull miniſtery, and ſees things par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly applied &amp; followed, oh, how then it begins to be at a ſtand! <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.12. there the Text ſaith, <hi>The word of God is quick and powerfull, and ſharper than any two edged ſword piercing even to the dividing aſunder of ſoule, and ſpirit, and of the joynts and marrow, and is a diſcerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart.</hi> When a man preaches powerfully, he preaches as if hee were in the boſome of a man: he may tell him things in his eare which he thinks no man knowes of, <hi>Therefore,</hi> ſaith Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.1.2, <hi>ſeeing we have this miniſtery, as we have received mercy we faint not. But have renounced the hidden things of diſhoneſty, not walking in craftineſſe, not handling the word of God deceitfully, but by manifeſtation of the truth, commending our ſelues to every mans conſcience in the ſight of God.</hi> As if hee ſhould ſay, Wee doe not ſet another colour upon the word of God: as (the word implieth being taken from tradeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men that would ſet a faire colour &amp; gloſſe u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon their wares, and make them ſeem other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe than they are:) we doe not doe thus, ſaith the Apoſtle: but our word goeth home vnto your conſciences, and diſcovers what is in your hearts.</p>
               <p>Secondly, as the word powerfully prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched doth diſcover what is in a mans heart,
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:4399:44"/>
and driveth his ſoule to an amazement by reaſon of the ſin that is in it: ſo alſo it drives the ſoule into an awe of ſin, ſo that it dares not meddle with ſin as it did before; it over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poureth the ſoule of a poore ſinner, and makes him affraid of ſin; and nothing but the word can doe it, nothing but the powerfull delivery of the word will do it. <hi>Luke</hi> 3.9, 10. when <hi>Iohn</hi> preached the word powerfully, <hi>the people</hi> came to him, and asked him, <hi>ſaying, What ſhall we doe? Then came the Publicans</hi> (which were ranked among the worſt compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny) <hi>to be baptized, and ſaid unto him, Maſter what ſhall we doe? And the ſouldiers asked him, What ſhall wee doe?</hi> So that all came un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the powerfull miniſtery of S. <hi>Iohn.</hi> So <hi>Matth.</hi> 7.29. where the Text ſaith, <hi>Chriſt taught as one having authority, and not as the Scribes and Phariſees:</hi> what is the meaning of this? The meaning is, hee taught as hee would command mens conſciences: not that he converted all he preached unto (for it is probable that Saint <hi>Peter</hi> converted more than ever Chriſt did:) but hee did command the conſciences of men, he made men either yeeld to his doctrine, and be humbled, or elſe he made them know, that they ſhould be condemned by his word for ever. Our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour did not preach as the Scribes and Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees, that made a lazie tale to the people, and when he was gone, no man was affected
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:4399:45"/>
with it. No, no, Chriſt commands the conſciences of men, and either made them ſeale to his truth, or elſe ſealed them up to condemnation. His doctrine drave the ſoules of his hearers to a ſtand, hee did convince their conſciences that that which he taught was true, they could not deny it. And this is to teach <hi>with authority,</hi> this is the nature of the worke of the Lord in the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtery of the word when it commeth with power: ſo that it is plaine, that a power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full miniſtery, which with a particular ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication couragiouſly applieth the word of God to mens ſoules, and with ſoundneſſe of argument conuinceth, and with zealous and fervent affection is delivered, will both diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover ſin, and over-power ſin in the hearts of men, and ſo fit and prepare them for the receiving, entertaining, and welcomming of the Lord Ieſus Chriſt.</p>

Secondly, God worketh onely with this meanes, and bleſſeth it onely; this is the ſword of the Spirit. The Spirit of the Lord moveth onely with this means: and therefore nothing but this can do it.</p>

<pb n="83" facs="tcp:4399:45"/>
is a powerfull miniſtery the onely meanes to doe it?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> I anſwer,<note place="margin">Affliction prepares the heart for the word, the word for God.</note> that afflictions may prepare mens hearts for the word, but not immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately for God: that is, theſe, if they be bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed unto men, goe thus farre, they open the eyes of a man in ſo much that he is willing to heare and attend unto the word, and be infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by it, and is content to take the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell of God: but the word is that, which im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately prepares mens hearts for the Lord.

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> I anſwer, that the word of God is but an inſtrument: now the Lord is a free-worker, a voluntary agent, as we uſe to ſay; he may doe what he will, and when he will with his inſtrument, A powerful miniſtery is the only ordinary means to prepare mens hearts for Chriſt: but God worketh with this means where hee will, and upon whom
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:4399:46"/>
he will. And as hee may prepare a man for himſelfe by this meanes, ſo he may harden him by it: the word is able to prepare a man, but God worketh with it, upon whom hee will, and how he will, as it pleaſeth him.</p>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe </seg>1</label> The Vſe of this point is firſt for Miniſters. Is it ſo that a powerfull miniſtery is the ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall means ordinarily to prepare the ſoule for the Lord?<note place="margin">Much fault in Miniſters, that their peoples hearts are not fitted for Chriſt.</note> then from hence the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of God may ſee the reaſon of the little good they doe in that courſe and place wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in God hath ſet them: here lieth the ground of it, we preach and take paines, but the worke of God proſpereth not in our hands; after many yeeres hewing there is not one mountain levelled, ſcarce one ſinner brought home to the Lord Ieſus, and truely prepared for him. What is the reaſon of this? Surely leaving ſecrets and times unto God, (for God may convert when he will, and there are ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons wherein God will not vouchſafe any ſaving grace unto men: but leaving theſe things to God,) this wee know in general, that God is as powerfull as ever he was, the miniſtery is as effectuall as ever it was, if it be performed in a right manner. We need not complaine as <hi>Eliſha</hi> did, Where <hi>is the God of Elijah,?</hi> He is not wanting: but if <hi>the ſpirit and power of Elias</hi> be wanting in us, the fault is ours. For the ſword of the ſpirit is as powerfull as ever it was. If the miniſtery of
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:4399:46"/>
God were diſpenſed as it ſhould, it would be as effectuall as ever it was, it would worke to ſaluation. But where lies the fault? Alas that lieth in the miniſters of God, who doe not performe the worke of the miniſtery as it ſhould and with that power they ought. A ſword in a childs hand, though never ſo ſharp, will doe no harme: but if it be put into a ſtrong mans hand, he wil make it cut deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. Too many of Gods Miniſters haue weak hearts, little affection have they to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God, little labour is there in their hearts to pluck men unto heaven, they doe not ſtrive with ſoules as they ought to doe, they doe not ſtruggle with the hearts of men: if they have their profits and liberties, they care not. And hence it is that little good is done by them, they do ſo marvellouſly faile in the former particulars. Where is that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular and courageous applying of the truth to mens foules and conſciences? Alas, what coverings they have freinds, they muſt not be diſpleaſed: and great men they are afraid they ſhould bee offended. It is pitty but their tongues ſhould cleave to the roofes of their mouthes, if they ſpeake any thing the leſſe for theſe baſe and by reſpects than God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veales and requireth of them. Their ſlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and paſſing by is the reaſon that men pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit ſo little by their miniſtery: they are aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to tell, and affraid to ſpeak to the hearts
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:4399:47"/>
of men, and reprove them for thoſe ſinnes which they are not aſhamed or affraid to doe in the face of the world. They convince not ſo ſoundly as they ought to doe, they doe not gather in thoſe arguments which may make thoſe truths undeniable, and mens conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces at a ſtand. If they can but careleſly, and idely talke out the houre, what becomes of the ſeed, what becomes of the word, what becomes of mens ſoules they care not: againe they want that holy ſpirituall affection which they ſhould deliver Gods word withall unto his people. This is the ſumme of all, Miniſters doe not deliver the word with a heavenly, hearty, and violent affection, they doe not ſpeake out of the abundance of their affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. If they would ſpeake againſt ſin with a holy indignation, it would make men ſtand in awe of ſin, they talke of it overly, and ſay, It is not good to profane Gods Name &amp; his Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baths, and to live an ungodly life: but they doe not ſpeake from their hearts in this kind. A ſturdy meſſenger,, if hee come to a mans houſe, to ſpeake with him, he will not be put off, he will take no deniall, but he will ſpeake with him, if it be poſſible, before he goes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way: but ſend a child of a meſſage to a man, if a ſervant doe but tell him his maiſter is not at leiſure, or that he may ſpeake with him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother time, he will eaſily be put off, and goe away before hee hath delivered his meſſage.
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:4399:47"/>
So it is with a Miniſter that performes his office with a hearty affection. For when a man ſpeakes from his heart (in this caſe) he will haue no anſwer, he will not bee dallied withall, he will take no deniall, but will haue that he came for. If a man ſhould ſay, he is not at leiſure to ſpeake with him, or to heare him now, he will ſpeake with him another time; he will not goe away with this anſwer, but he will tell him, I came to ſpeake with your hearts, and I will ſpeake with your hearts: he will ſay to the people, Tell your hearts you that love the world, and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits and pleaſures thereof (and my heart tels you) did you but know the good things that are in Chriſt Ieſus, did you but know what a happy thing it is to have the aſſurance of Gods mercy, you would never love ſin, or delight in wickedneſſe as you have done heretofore I came to ſpeake with your hearts, and will ſpeake with them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we part. Grieve no more for the things of this world, but for your ſins. The day is comming when the heavens ſhall melt with fire, and ye ſhall heare the voice of the Arch-angell, ſaying ariſe ye dead, and appeare be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the judgement ſeat of God; where you ſhall heare that woefull and bitter ſentence, <hi>Away from me all yee workers of iniquity, I know you not.</hi>

Now in the way of preface let me ſhew how farre we have gone: ſecondly, let mee ſhew you how I meane to goe on in this worke, if God give leaue and liberty. For the firſt: I told you that the maine which wee aimed at, is, to take notice how the ſoule may come to have an intereſt and a title to Chriſt, and how to come to be poſſeſſed of him, and of all that great redemption which he hath wrought. Now the application of this diſcovers it ſelfe in two things: firſt, there muſt be a preparation: ſecondly, there muſt be an ingrafting of the ſoule into Chriſt before the heart can come to be partaker of that ſap, or of that ſaving grace which is in Chriſt, and which will flow from him to all that have any intereſt in him through faith.</p>
               <p>There muſt be a preparation, before the ſinner can come to receive Chriſt.

                  <note place="margin">1 Cor. 2, 14.</note> he cannot receive them, <hi>becauſe they are foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhneſſe to him.</hi> So that there muſt be a prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the ſoule, before Chriſt will come and take poſſeſſion of it: and an emptying of the ſoule, before Chriſt will fill it.</p>
               <p>Now this preparation made it ſelfe known,<note place="margin">Preparation for Chriſt, ſtands in two things.</note> (as you remember) in two particulars: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> firſt in the diſpenſation of the worke on Gods part, that is, the Lord drawes the ſinner from himſelfe and his corruption, and breakes that curſed league and combination that is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween ſin &amp; the ſoule: he rends the heart from it: for as our Saviour Chriſt ſaith, <hi>No man can come to the Son, except the Father draw him, Iohn</hi> 6.44. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly as the diſpenſation on Gods part: ſo there is ſomething for the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition which God workes upon the hearts of all that he will prepare for Chriſt: and that is known in two workes, contrition, and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation, which we have already handled.<note place="margin">Two things keepe from Chriſt.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe were not things of meere comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but of neceſſity required, as wee haue diſputed: and it is requiſite, that the ſoule have both the workes of contrition, and of humilation. For there are two maine hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derances which keepe the ſoule off from Chriſt: as firſt, ſecurity in his owne eſtate, whereby the heart is blinded and deluded, and ſets up his ſtand, and is at reſt and quiet
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:4399:52"/>
in his condition, and hee ſeeth no need of any better: and from hence naturall men thinke it needleſſe for Miniſters to diſquiet them; and they ſay, What would you have done by us? And they thinke it a matter of curioſitie, either to have their hearts chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, or their lives reformed.</p>
               <p>Now therefore the Lord ſends in this worke of contrition, and pierceth the heart thorow, and lets in the horrour of his vengeance, and makes the ſoule ſee that if he will have his ſin, he muſt have his damnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on too: and by this time the ſoule comes to ſee need of a change: and hee ſeeth if he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue thus, he is an undone man, and ſhall be damned for ever. Thus the Lord pluckes away the ſoule from that ſecuritie wherein naturally it is ſetled. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> The ſecond thing which keeps him off from Chriſt, is carnall confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence: for when the ſinner ſeeth his miſery by reaſon of his ſin that lodgeth in his heart, and that hath been committed by him, then he begins to ſeeke ſuccour, and to ſcramble for his owne comfort. Well, he ſeeth that ſin is dangerous, and he will mend now, and reforme all that God condemnes him in, and he thinkes ovt of his owne power to ſave his owne ſoule, and to give God content, and to make amends for all that he hath done amiſſe. This is his carnall confidence which he hath in his owne ſelfe-ſufficiency: and here ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:4399:52"/>
thouſands of ſoules periſh, reſting meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the huske and ſhell of their prayers and hearing, which in themſelves are good and commendable, but they are no Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours or Saviours to us. Therefore, that the Lord may plucke the ſoule from this car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall confidence, he ſends out another great worke of humiliation, and makes the ſoule ſee the weakneſſe, and emptineſſe of its du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and that there is enough in its beſt ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices to condemne him, and for which the Lords wrath may confound him for ever. And now the ſoule ſeeth that notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding all his prayers and hearings, yet his ſin remaines, yea remaines unpardoned, his cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions are not ſubdued, his conſcience not quieted: and therefore deſpairing of all help in himſelfe, or in the creature, he falls down at the foot of the Lord, and is content to be at Gods diſpoſe: and when the ſoule is thus fitted, then it is prepared to goe out of it ſelfe, and to lay hold upon the Lord Ieſus Chriſt, and upon the fountain of all that good that works all good in him. This humiliation works, and this is the fitting of the ſoule for Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Thus farre we have gone: all this while the poore ſinner is like the children of <hi>Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el</hi> travelling in the wilderneſſe, partly in the valley of teares, and partly in the vaſt wil<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>derneſſe; they did not immediately come
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:4399:53"/>
into the Land of Canaan, but were wandring under the hands of <hi>Moſes,</hi> which was a type of the Law, and <hi>Ioſhua</hi> a type of <hi>Ieſus Chriſt,</hi> and <hi>Egypt</hi> the reſemblance of a mans miſery under ſin and Sathan; and their wandring in the wilderneſſe was like the humbling and breaking of the ſoule, that the Lord may doe it good. Now wee are juſt upon the coaſts of Canaan, and hard by all thoſe ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall good things that Chriſt hath purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed for us: and when the ſoule is thus fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and prepared, there is nothing to bee done but to goe into the good land and take poſſeſſion: I meane when the heart is thus rent from himſelfe and his corruption, then he muſt lay hold upon Chriſt, and enter into the good Land: but before we goe, we muſt haue the command of our ſpiritual <hi>Ioſhua</hi> to ſet us in poſſeſſion of it.</p>
               <p>Thus you ſee the ſoule is like a graft cut off from the old ſtock by contrition, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo pared and fitted by humiliation, in regard of any ſelfe-ſufficiency.</p>
               <p>Now the nex part that we are to handle, is the ingraffing of the ſoule into Chriſt: and I will doe two things in the handling of this great work of ingraffing. Firſt, I will diſcover the generall nature of this worke, leaving all the difficulties and particulars of it till after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,<note place="margin">See it in the 2. Doctrine.</note> if God give liberty: ſecondly, I will ſhew you how the ſoule is ingraffed into Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="99" facs="tcp:4399:53"/>1. What this ingraffing is.<note place="margin">What ingraf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fing into Chriſt is.</note> This being in Chriſt, may be thus deſcribed to you: It is a worke of the Spirit of God, whereby the humbled ſinner ſtands poſſeſſed of Chriſt, and all the good that is in Chriſt. In this deſcription you may take notice of three things, which are the ſpeciall guides to you for the vnderſtanding of that which we will treat of.</p>
               <p>Firſt, that the humbled ſinner ſtands poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed of Chriſt: for he that is not humbled and broken hearted, hath nothing to doe with Chriſt, nor comfort comming from him. I uſe this phraſe, He ſtands poſſeſſed of Chriſt, rather then that, Hee poſſeſſeth Chriſt; becauſe the worke lies on Chriſts part. The Spirit of the Lord Ieſus takes poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of and humbled ſinner, and makes him part of his care; and hee comes by that meanes to bee intereſſed into the care of Chriſt: Chriſt poſſeſſeth him, and by this meanes he comes to be poſſeſſed of Chriſt: ſo that all he hath, is meerely the worke of the Spirit of God upon him: as the Apoſtle ſaith <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.9, <hi>But now that you haue known God, or rather are known of God.</hi> It is not what wee conceive, or what wee know, but what hee knows and conceives: and in <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.14. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſtrove hard, <hi>If that I may apprehend that for which alſo I am apprehended of him.</hi> He doth not ſay that hee is able to apprehend
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:4399:54"/>
God, but that God comprehends him: As it is with a little child, that is not able to goe of it ſelfe, the father takes the child in his hand and then it is able to go. The child holds the father, not becauſe it hath any power of it ſelfe, but becauſe the father holds him: ſo we hold the Lord Ieſus Chriſt, becauſe we are holden of him: for the humbled ſoule ſtands poſſeſſed of Chriſt, becauſe Chriſt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth him his care, and his charge, and takes poſſeſſion of him, and therefore he comes to have an intereſt in Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Secondly, as he ſtands poſſeſſed of Chriſt, ſo he is made partaker of all the ſpirituall good things that are in Chriſt: ſtill the action lies chiefly upon Chriſt, and we ſo move, as we are firſt moued by him; and we ſo worke as we are wrought upon by him: He is made partaker of all the good in Chriſt, not becauſe hee can challenge it, but becauſe the Lord will convey and communicate it to him. Theſe two things you ſhall obſerue to be general operations, and to go through all the works of application of Chriſt: as in vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, the Lord by his Spirit doth draw the ſoule after him; there is the poſſeſſion of Chriſt, and then the ſoule follows Chriſt, and comes to him: and in juſtification, Chriſt undertakes for the ſinner, and layes downe the payment of the debt for him, and then he freeth the ſinner from the debt: thus the ſoul
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:4399:54"/>
is neerer ſtill: and in adoption, God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther taketh him in the roome and right of a ſon, and then he ſtands further poſſeſſed of grace; and withall the Lord eſtates him in all the priviledges of grace, in meekneſſe, and holineſſe, and he ſets his ſeale to him, and gives him his marke: and withall, he is free from the power and dominion of his corruptions. So that theſe two are generall things, and have a kind of conveyance of themſelves over all the whole worke of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, the laſt thing in the deſcription is this; All this is done by the worke of Gods Spirit. For the graft cannot be planted, till it be cut off and pared. It muſt have the ſame hand that cut it off, and pared it by contriti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and humiliation: for the ſame hand of the ſame Spirit muſt ingraft the ſoule into Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Now for the following diſcourſe, we haue choſen theſe words of the Prophet <hi>Mala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy,</hi> from which we will take onely ſo much as will ſerue our turne for that wee have to ſpeake.</p>
               <p>Theſe words are nothing elſe but a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy of the miniſterie of <hi>Iohn</hi> Baptiſt, and in them two things principally conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable:</p>
               <p>Firſt, the worke of the miniſtery of <hi>Iohn</hi> Baptiſt, <hi>Mal.</hi> 3.1. <hi>Behold, I ſend my meſſenger
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:4399:55"/>
to prepare my way before mee.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, The conſequent good that flowes from this, <hi>And the Lord whom ye ſeeke ſhall ſuddenly come into his Temple.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As great men have their harbingers to make ready their way before them, and to make preparation for them before they come to any place; ſo it is with the Lord of life, hee is the great Commander of the world, it is he that takes poſſeſſion of the hearts of all that belong to life and happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe: but before he comes to take poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, he ſends <hi>Iohn</hi> Baptiſt to prepare the heart and when it is fitted, then he <hi>comes ſudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly into his Temple.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here conſider, Firſt, What the Temple is.</p>
               <p>Secondly, What it is to <hi>come into his Temple,</hi> and how Chriſt commeth into it.</p>
               <p>This word <hi>Temple,</hi> beſides the natural and literall ſenſe of it, wherein it aimes at the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriall Temple of Ieruſalem, which we will not meddle with,<note place="margin">Chriſts tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple is ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all.</note> is taken ſpiritually, and ſo it is to be conceived here: and then it implies the Church of Chriſt in the number of the faithfull. You ſhall ſee the phraſe of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to intimate ſo much, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.17. <hi>If judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment begin at the houſe of God, what ſhall the end of the ungodly be, that obey not the Goſpell of God?</hi> There the houſe of God is oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to them that obey not the truth of God, ſo that they that obey the truth, that are wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:4399:55"/>
to bee at the diſpoſe of God, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme their lives after his will and word: they are the houſe and temple of Chriſt. As in generall, all the people of God, thus obeying the word of God: ſo in particular, euery Chriſtian man and woman is the Temple of Chriſt. As the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>You are the Temples of the living God.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 Cor. 6 16;</note> As it was in the materiall Temple in Ieruſalem, the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the Lord filled it, and the Lord ſaid he would dwell in it for ever: ſo the heart true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly prepared is the Temple of the Lord, and the Lord Chriſt takes poſſeſſion, and rules in it, and fils it with all grace. This is the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the firſt word. It is plaine by force of argument: The word <hi>Temple</hi> is to bee taken in the ſame ſenſe in which the way to the temple is taken:<note place="margin">As alſo the way to the Temple.</note> but the way to the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple is the fitting of the ſoule and the heart for Chriſt; for ſo all the Evangeliſts expreſſe it: <hi>Iohn</hi> ſaith, <hi>Repent yee for the kingdome of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven is at hand, Mat.</hi> 3.2.<note place="margin">Iſa. 40.3.</note> Alſo <hi>Iſaiah</hi> ſaith <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare ye the way of the Lord, make his paths ſtraight.</hi> So that the preparation of the way to the Lord is nothing elſe but for peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to repent of their ſins. Repenting and preparing are both one. But more eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that place of Saint <hi>Luke, ch.</hi> 1. <hi>ver.</hi> 15.17. where ſpeaking of <hi>Iohn</hi> Baptiſt, he ſaith, <hi>He ſhall bee full of the holy Ghoſt:</hi> nay, <hi>Hee ſhall come in the ſpirit and power of Elias, to turne

the hearts of the fathers to the children, and the diſobedient to the wiſedome of the juſt, to make ready a people prepared for the Lord:</hi> The way is in the heart of a man, and this preparation is the turning of their hearts to the way of the juſt men. And that other place in <hi>Luke</hi> 3.5.6 can admit of no other ſenſe, <hi>Every valley ſhall be filled, and every mountaine and hill ſhall be brought low: And all fleſh ſhall ſee the ſalvation of God.</hi> Theſe words cannot be literally underſtood, for there was no moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines to be removed, nor no vallies to bee filled up, for Chriſt was no temporall King: but the meaning is, a removeall of all thoſe mountains and impediments that ſtood be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene Chriſt and the ſoule. Thus you ſee the Temple prepared is nothing, but the heart truely broken and humbled.</p>
               <p>Secondly, let us ſee what it is to come in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this Temple.<note place="margin">And Chriſts comming to it.</note> As the way and the Temple was, ſo the comming into this Temple is to be ſpiritually underſtood, and that is, when the Lord Ieſus Chriſt comes to take poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of him: but conſider this, he comes like a King, and therefore hee hath <hi>Iohn</hi> Baptiſt to make way for him, The comming of a King diſcovers it ſelfe in two things: firſt the King taketh the Soveraigne command of the place where he is, and if there be any gueſts there, they muſt be gone, and reſigne up all the houſe to him: ſo the Lord Ieſus comes
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:4399:58"/>
to take ſoveraigne poſſeſſion of the ſoule. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, the King brings all his proviſion with him ſo the Lord Chriſt brings all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion for the ſoule with him.</p>
               <p>So then the meaning is this; When <hi>Iohn</hi> Baptiſt by the power of the word hath wrovght upon the ſoule, and made it humble and low, and willing to be at the Lords diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe: when the broken heart ſeeks for a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, then the Lord comes ſuddenly, and like a King. You humble ſoules conſider this he will take poſſeſſion of thoſe humble broken hearts of yours, and he will bring his owne proviſion with him; he cares for nothing but a veſſell emptied, and a heart thus fitted and prepared: he will bring proviſion enough, of comfort, of vocation, of adoption, of ſanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, and the like.</p>
               <p>In this part of the verſe thus opened wee have two doctrines: firſt, that the Lord Ieſus Chriſt will not delay to come into the heart that is truely humbled and broken. Who is the Lord? Chriſt. What is the Temple? The heart truely humbled. And when comes he? Suddenly: this is the ground of the doctrine. The ſecond is; the Lord Ieſus takes poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the ſoule humbled, and provides for it as his owne: he comes like a King, as I ſaid before. This is the ground of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond point, which diſcovers the nature of the implantation: the firſt diſcouers the appur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenances of it.</p>
               <p>

                  <note place="margin">Chriſt delays not to come into an hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled heart.</note>For the firſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Lord Ieſus will not delay to come into the heart truely humbled:</hi> as I may ſay, he lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth all other workes aſide, as if he did looke for none but this, how he may come home to the heart truely humbled. The Lord will not come at a proud worldly minded man: No, the Lord leaves all; yea heaven and all the world, and onely lookes after, and loues to live with the humble broken heart.</p>
               <p>For proofe of the point. This is the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why the Scripture doth not content it ſelfe to ſhew the marvellous delight that God hath in ſuch a ſpirit. See how plenteous the Scripture is to ſhew how ready the Lord is to call in at the heart of the humbled ſoule, and to riſe, and lie, and reſt, to eat, and drink, and ſleep with the humble heart: nay when he is come, he wil not away againe, as wee may ſee in that example of the loſt ſon, <hi>Luke</hi> 15.20. Hee ſaid, <hi>I will ariſe and goe to my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and ſay, Father, I have ſinned againſt heaven and before thee, and am not worthy to bee called thy ſon, make me as one of thy hired ſervants.</hi> As ſoone as ever he reſolved of the worke, marke how the father behaues himſelfe towards him, though he were baſe and beggarly in his condition. He might have ſaid, Let thy Harlots and thy Queanes helpe thee: But he ſaw him a far off, and ran
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:4399:59"/>
to meet him, and fell upon his neck, and kiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed him. Though he were a wretched creature yet now he becauſe the father ſaw him hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, he remembers not that he had been with Harlots, all was forgotten; the father ſaw him afarre off, before the child could ſpie him; he pittied him before he could confeſſe his ſin: he was more ready to meet him than he was to come, and he kiſſed him before he could receiue any acknowledgement from him. This is the marvellous enlargement of the Lord to receive an humble broken heart And when he had kiſſed him,<note place="margin">Luk 15.21, 22</note> the loſt child ſaid, <hi>Father, I have ſinned againſt heaven, and before thee, and am no more worthy to bee cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led thy ſon. But the father ſaid to his ſervants Bring forth the beſt robe, and put it on him, and put a ring upon his hand,</hi> and ſo forth: as if he had ſaid, It is no matter what thou haſt bin now thou art come home, and haſt hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled thy ſelfe, I am glad of it: Thus he paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth by all the former miſdemenours. And ſo it is in the ſame Chapter, <hi>ver,</hi> 4.5.6. <hi>If a man have an hundred ſheep, and loſe one, will he not leaue the ninety nine, and ſeek that which was loſt? And when hee hath found it, hee layeth it on his ſhoulders rejoycing. And when he comes home, he calleth together his friends, and ſaith, Rejoyce with me, for I have found my loſt ſheep.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The meaning is this: The loſt ſheep is the
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:4399:60"/>
loſt ſinner that is wandred from the Lord Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt. The ſoule, that after all the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies and favours that God hath ſhewed to allure him, he goes away from God, and then one drops in a ditch, and another is loſt in the wilderneſſe or Forreſt: yet hee leaues all to ſeeke the loſt ſheepe, and leaveth not ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king till he findeth it, and if he hath found it he reioyceth. For the Lord will leave all to ſeeke a poore loſt ſinner, and the more need thou haſt, and the more loſt thou art in thy ſelfe, the more labour will the Lord take to find thee out: and though thou canſt not goe the Lord will carry thee upon his ſhoulders; and when thou art come home, hee rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth exceedingly. This ſhewes the marvel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous bounty of the Lord to poore ſinners: it is the ſcope of the Parable concerning the Pearle, <hi>Matth.</hi> 13.45.46. <hi>The kingdome of heaven is like unto a wiſe Merchant man, who having found one Pearle of great Price, went and ſold all that he had to buy it.</hi> The pearle is nothing elſe but that rich mercy of God in his ſon Chriſt, and Chriſt in the promiſe is the Pearle, and the Merchant-man is every Chriſtian man that wants mercy and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort to releive him; for he ſaith, What is all the world to me if my ſoule wants mercy? Well he knowes where the Pearle is. What's the price of it? Sell all. Selling of all is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but this when a man is content to
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:4399:60"/>
part with ſin and all carnal confidence in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, and he ſeeth himſelf miſerable becauſe of ſin, and utterly unable to ſuccour him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, and is content to part with wit, or parts, or gifts, and all that hee hath for the Lord Ieſus Chriſt then ſuddenly he hath the Pearle. If it be ſo ſaith the Lord, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing will quiet thee but the Lord Chriſt, and mercy from him, then take mercy. If chapmen bid roundly, you ſhall not need to ſtand higling for it. Would you have Chriſt to comfort you, and pardon you? then lay away all your luſts and corruptions, and the world, and all the haunts of your hearts, and all the diſtempers that are in them. Do this, and the Lord will give you the Pearle, he will giue you Chriſt, and mercy from him.</p>
               <p>The Reaſons why the Lord will not delay to come to the humbled ſoule, are three:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reaſon</hi> 1. The Lord Ieſus Chriſt was ſent for this very end by God the Father, as <hi>Mat.</hi> 15.24, <hi>I am not ſent but unto the loſt ſheep of the houſe of Iſrael.</hi> And not onely ſo, but Chriſt came for that end: as <hi>Luke</hi> 19.10. <hi>The Son of man is come to ſeek, and to ſave that which was loſt:</hi> the end of God the fathers ſending of him, and the maine ſcope of his comming was, to ſeek and ſaue that which was loſt, that is, that is loſt in the ſight and ſenſe of his own miſery, and loſt in regard of his owne
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:4399:61"/>
inſufficiency to helpe himſelfe; for the loſt man is willing to be guided by another. If you ſhould find a man in the wilderneſſe, and ſay, Friend, this is not the way, would not he be contented to heare and to yeeld to it? So if thou be loſt, if thou ſeeſt thy owne miſery for ſin, and that if thou lie in this eſtate thou art a damned man, and if thou ſee thy ſelfe loſt in regard of thy owne inſufficiency to help thy ſelfe, and that thou art not able to get out of this condition and miſery, wherein thou art willing to be reformed, and to bee diſpoſed of: then know that the <hi>Sonne of man,</hi> the Lord Chriſt Ieſus, <hi>came to ſeeke and ſave ſuch loſt ſinners;</hi> and when he hath found them, he will not leave them in this loſt eſtate, but will ſave them. If this be then the end of God the Fathers ſending him, and the ſcope of Chriſts comming to ſave the loſt ſinner, then certainly above all hee will bee faithfull in that for which hee came, hee will undoubtedly ſave thoſe that are loſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reaſon</hi> 2. Becauſe the humbled broken hearted ſinner is the fitteſt ſubiect to ſet out theſe praiſes of this glorious work of our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption; he is the fitteſt for God to work upon, and for the Lord Chriſt to dwell in, and he is the fitteſt to ſet out the praiſe of that rich grace in Chriſt, as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.11. <hi>Who worketh all things according
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:4399:61"/>
to the counſell of his owne will.</hi> Why? <hi>That we ſhould bee to the praiſe of his glorious grace.</hi> Therefore now conſider it; there is no ſoule ſo fitting to ſet forth the glorious grace of Chriſt, and the great worke of our redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption; as the poore humbled ſelfe-denying heart: for the humbled ſoule waites for all grace from God, and is willing to returne all to God againe; and hee ſaith, I am not worthy of the leaſt mercy I need; and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he is contented that God deny him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing. This man is the fitteſt to ſet forth the great worke of God, and to further the aime of God in ſetting forth the riches of his glorious grace: it is all grace from the beginning to the end, as <hi>Zechariah</hi> hath it, chap. 4.7. Grace laid the firſt ſtone, and grace laid the laſt ſtone, and all the people cried, ſaying, <hi>Grace, Grace,</hi> ſo the humbled ſoule ſets forth the praiſe of God, and ſaith, I deſerue nothing but hell, and whatſoever I have more than hell, it is all from the Lord and all glory is due to him: it is grace that I live, and it is grace that I perſevere; it is all grace, from election to glorification: whereas the proud heart ſpoiles all the work of God. And it is no wonder though God will not dwell with a proud heart. The proud heart, for what he hath, and for what he can doe, gives all to himſelfe: where is grace now? The humble heart is like a great ſhop,
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:4399:62"/>
where the great frame of mans ſaluation may beſt be ſeen: (for there are many dark ſhops that deceive the buyer, and marre the wares too): for the humbled heart ſaith, The worke of the Lord is marvellous in our eyes and ought to be marvellous in our hearts. No man will dwell in a houſe, but where his credit may bee maintained, and for his conveniency: if either of theſe may be hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred by it, he will not dwell in that houſe. Its no wonder then though the Lord Ieſus come to dwell in the heart of an humbled ſoule. Chriſt would work, and the humbled ſoule is contented with it; and Chriſt would have all the glory from the humbled ſoule, and he is well contented to give all the glory to God. We uſe to ſay in the ſchooles, If any man have diſpoſed of his dwelling, and fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med the building, and fitted it, he wil ſet it up except he either want wiſedome, and knows not how to doe it; or elſe power, and is not able to perfect that worke which he hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun. Theſe cannot befall God. A wiſe effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient cauſe never framed any matter, but he brings in the frame, and ſets it up. Hee that hath fitted and framed all the materials of his building, if he will not make up the frame for himſelfe, it is either becauſe hee wants power and cannot doe it, or elſe wants wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and knowes not how to doe it; but the Lord that hath fitted the heart for himſelfe,
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:4399:62"/>
that all may be done by him, and all the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the worke come to him againe, he nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wants power nor wiſedome to finiſh the worke; hee hath begun, and therefore he will not deferre, but will come ſuddenly and take poſſeſſion of him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reaſon</hi> 3. Laſtly, the Lord will not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre to come to dwell in an humbled heart, becauſe all hinderances are now taken away, and therefore the place is ready to receive him, and he ready to come, certainly he will come without delay. If there be any hind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derances to keepe out Chriſt it muſt be ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther on Chriſts part, or on our parts: but in the humble heart there is nothing to hinder it, If any thing keepe us off from Chriſt, it is either becauſe we loue our ſelues, or our corruptions. Now the humble heart hath renounced both of theſe, and the humble ſoule ſaith, My ſin ſhall not rule me, and, my ſelfe cannot ſave me, therefore let the Lord Ieſus Chriſt come and take poſſeſſion of my heart. The humble heart hath renoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced ſin and himſelfe, and now he would have the Lord Ieſus Chriſt to be his King and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour. Now all the hinderances muſt bee on Chriſts part: and that cannot be granted for Chriſt is ſo farre from being unwilling that he deſires to come in: for he hath knockt at many a proud heart: Behold, <hi>I ſtand at the doore and knock: if any man heare my voyce,
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:4399:63"/>
and open unto me, I will come into him and will ſup with him, and he with me, Rev.</hi> 3.20. And in other places he ſaith, Forſake thy ſins and corruptions, and receive thy owne ſalvation and be not under the rule of ſinne and thoſe baſe luſts.<note place="margin">Cant. 5.2.</note> 
                  <hi>Open my love, my dove, my undefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led.</hi> Surely if the doore were open he would come in: nay himſelfe ſaith ſo profeſſedly, as in that place aforenamed. Oh hee hath knocked many a time at the heart of a poore wretch, and ſaid, <hi>If any man will open to me, I will come in. If any;</hi> He that promiſeth to come in if the doore were open, there is no unwillingneſſe on his part: but in the hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled ſoule there are no more lets, for he hath thrown away ſin in himſelfe, and ſaid, I love you not, I regard you not, let the Lord Ieſus come and rule in this ſame broken heart of mine.</p>
               <p>Thus gather up all: If it be the end of God the Fathers ſending Chriſt, and the ſcope of Chriſts comming, and if the glory of his grace bee much more advanced this way, and if there be no hinderances, then im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately expect him, hee commeth ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly.</p>

This is the undoubted argument of a graceleſſe ſpirit: either Chriſt erres, or elſe thou art out of the way; either Chriſt is to be blamed for his practice, or thou. Doth he come to ſuch as are humbled and art thou weary of them? Thou art a graceleſſe ſoule, and an enemy to the Lord of life, When the people of Iſrael began to ſpeake of going into the wilderneſſe to ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice to the Lord their God, they did ſtinke, and were abominable in the eyes of <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh</hi> and the <hi>Egyptians:</hi> indeed the <hi>Egypti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> did alwayes diſlike them,<note place="margin">Exod. 5.21.</note> but now they were an abomination to them, This was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but a type: <hi>Pharaoh</hi> is the Devill, and this <hi>Egyptian</hi> ſervitude is our ſpirituall bondage under ſinne.

It will ſtick one day hard upon that mans heart, when he ſhall ſee the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellous excellency of that redemption which Chriſt hath wrought, and the beauty of that grace which Chriſt workes in the hearts of his, and the glory and happineſſe which hee hath prepared for, and will beſtow upon his ſervants: when (I ſay) in the houre of death, or in the day of judgement, he ſhall ſee him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe utterly deprived of this grace in Chriſt, he will then gnaw his owne fleſh that hee hath loſt heaven and happineſſe (it may be) for one baſe luſt. The covetous man will ſay If I had caſt away the world, I might haue had Chriſt and mercy: and the Adulterer will ſay, If I would have caſt away my baſe luſts and corruptions, Chriſt would haue dwelt in my heart, and would have purged my heart: and the proud hipocrite will ſay, If I had laid away my owne vanity, and my owne pride, the Lord would haue taken poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion

When the ſins of thy youth ſhall ſeize upon thee, and thou ſhalt ſee hell gaping ready to ſwallow thee up, and deſtruction ready to take poſſeſſion of thee, and Sathan ſhall lay grievous accuſations againſt thee; and time (I ſay) ſhall then come that thou wilt ſay, Ah that Chriſt would come to ſaue and helpe me a poore forlorne wretch! Will it not then be a gall to a mans heart to thinke of it? It will make him ſay, With what heart can I looke for grace or mercy from Chriſt, before whom I haue preferred the world, and my baſe luſts, and the deluſions of the world? and when the Lord Ieſus

to ſave thee now? No, no: let thy baſe luſts and corrupt companions ſave and ſuccour thee, and procure conſolation to thy ſoule, wofull comforters are they all: you will then think it a terrible thing that this Chriſt Ieſus (which now you will not haue your Saviour to purge and ſanctifie you) ſhal then be your Iudge, 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 1.8. <hi>The Lord Ieſus ſhall come in flaming fire, rendring vengeance to all that know him not.</hi> Thou that wilt not have Chriſt to take away all thy ſin, &amp; to rule in thee, and thou that haſt thruſt Chriſt out of thy heart, and from thy houſe, thou wilt wiſh that thou mighteſt never come to judgement: but Chriſt will come to thy coſt. Thou wouldſt not haue Chriſt to rule in thy heart: therefore he will come in ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance to execute upon thee all thoſe plagus threatned, and which thou haſt deſerved; and then ſtoppe him in judgement, if thou canſt. Now the way is ready, and the meanes ſet faire before your eyes: take the right courſe, and the Lord Ieſus will not deferre to come ſuddenly, doe you what you ſhould, and Chriſt will doe what you deſire.</p>

then I could be contented to have Chriſt: and the Adulterer ſaith, If I could haue Chriſt, and my Queanes, and my luſts: and the Hypocrite ſaith, If I might haue Chriſt and my ſecret haunts of heart, then I would be willing to yeeld; but if all thoſe corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions muſt be ſacrificed, and if Chriſt muſt take away all my corruptions from mee, and worke all in mee, this will be tedious.</p>

I would haue the heart of a poore Chriſtian doe as <hi>Shechem</hi> ſaith the heart of <hi>Hamor</hi> did when he would marry <hi>Dinah Gen.</hi> 34.22.23. <hi>Come let us be circumciſed as they are.

Thus he perſwades the hearts of the people to yeeld to him in it onely, but through the deſire of their goods. Let mee plead ſo with the ſoule of an humble ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner in this kind: thou muſt thinke of humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation as the Shechemite did of circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; I muſt never ſee the face of drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe

more, I muſt bid adieu to all carnall profits and pleaſures: Ah this goes to my heart, this pinches indeed, this ſtrikes to the quicke. They would bee circumciſed though it were painfull: how much more maiſt thou reaſon with thy owne heart, and ſay, It is tedious and irkeſome, but it wil be comfortable hereafter. Let us bee circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed and bid adieu to all our luſts, ſhall not all the ſubſtance of Chriſt Ieſus be ours? Let us forſake the world to have Chriſt, and not onely mercy ſhall bee ours, but euen every grace and comfort ſhal be ours, as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſaith, <hi>The God of all comfort and conſolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is ours.</hi> If thou wilt be humbled, and part with the world, and cut away every luſt, and throw away all whatſoever, then all the pleaſures of his right hand ſhall bee ours: and all the happines of heaven ſhal be ours; nay, all the fatneſſe of the earth ſhall be ours: Suppoſe I muſt part with theſe,<note place="margin">Affatim dives eſt, qui cum Chriſto pauper eſt, Hieron.</note> I ſhall haue Chriſt for my riches; and if I part with friends, I ſhall haue Chriſt to ſtand by me, and if I part with honour here, I ſhall have Chriſt to honour me; and if I part with joy here, I ſhall have thoſe joyes which are not conceived by the heart of man. You fathers ſpeake of it to your children, and you husbands ſpeak of it to yourwives; let every ſoule be humbled, and take all mercy. Shall not all be ours? Fathers ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe

                  <hi>Ob.</hi> But the poore ſoule ſaith, I confeſſe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſhould bee hard, and nothing ſhould be deare, and I hope nothing ſhall bee too hard for me, ſo that I may gaine a Lord Ieſus Chriſt, if I know mine owne heart, and if I know it not, let the Lord make it knowne to mee. I ſee no ſufficiency in my ſelfe, over my ſin to ſuccour mee, and I have had a care to be burthened, and yet I ſee not a Saviour.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> I anſwer to this; Is this true? and is thy heart humbled as thou ſaiſt? then I ſay, the Lord Ieſus Chriſt is come, and hath come many a day though thou perceiveſt it not. So ſoone as thy ſoule is thus diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, the Lord Ieſus comes, and that ſudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly too, though thou knoweſt not at what time. As when <hi>Iacob</hi> fell aſleepe upon the ſtone, and the Lord had made known him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to him, he ſaid, <hi>Surely the Lord was in this place, and I was not aware of it.</hi> So I ſay, thou haſt beene truly humbled, and the Lord Chriſt is truely come, and thou knoweſt it not.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ob.</hi> But can this be that the ſoule ſhould bee poſſeſſed of Chriſt, and not apprehend a Chriſt?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Yes, it is not onely poſſible, but it is too ordinary: and the reaſons why it
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:4399:75"/>
is ſo, and the hinderances which keepe a ſoule from ſeeing, they are theſe foure in particular: for there be foure lets on our part.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Firſt, Chriſt may come into thy ſoule, and thou doſt not know him. As one man comes to another mans houſe, and happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly one that he hath loved and deſired too yet his gheſſe is ſuch, and the diſtance of the time ſo long ſince he ſaw him, that he may be there and his friend never the wiſer; ſo thou maiſt complaine that the Lord Chriſt is not in thy ſoule, &amp; yet knoweſt not when he is there: this is the ordinary miſtake in the ſoule, as it is in the ſight. <hi>Mat.</hi> 14.25, 26.27. Chriſt comes to his Diſciples walking <hi>upon the ſea,</hi> and they were all affraid, becauſe they had thought they had ſeen a Spirit, <hi>and they cried out for feare:</hi> but Chriſt ſaid, <hi>Be not afraid, it is I.</hi> Chriſt was then moſt neer to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort them, when they had thought it had bin a Spirit to affright them: and the fault was in their underſtanding, they could not diſcerne him. As it was in the bodily ſight, ſo it is in the ſpirituall eye: thou ſaiſt, it is many a day ſince the Lord Ieſus did open mine eyes, and burthen my ſoule, and made me wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and made my ſinnes loathſome to my ſelfe, and I could even be content to be rid of my ſelfe, to be rid of my ſin. Whence comes it that thou art content to ſee thy ſin? and whence is it that thou art burthened
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:4399:75"/>
with it, and that thou art content to bee rid of thy ſelfe, and ſin, and all? Is it not from Chriſt thy Saviour? whence is it that thou art content to lie under the word of God, and to be diſpoſed by it? Is it not from Chriſt? Did you never heare of a poore countryman that went to the King in his hunting, and asked him where the King was? It hath beene ſo in many deare ſaints of God; as <hi>Iohn</hi> 20.13.14, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> after the death and reſurrection of Chriſt, <hi>Mary</hi> went to looke for him, and the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell ſaid, <hi>Why weepeſt thou?</hi> and whom ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keſt thou? Oh, ſaith ſhee, <hi>Becauſe they have taken away my Lord, and I know not where they have laid him.</hi> Her ſoule did yerne af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Chriſt, and ſhee enquires of Chriſt, for Chriſt, and thought him to be the Gardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. Chriſt ſaid to her, <hi>Mary why weepeſt thou? then ſhee turned her ſelfe, and ſaid, Rabboni, that is, Maſter. Mary</hi> loved Chriſt and was acquainted with a Saviour; yet now becauſe of the ſuddenneſſe of it, ſhe underſtood him not, and therefore ſhee aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked him for a Saviour. So I may ſay to thee poore humbled ſoule, Why weepeſt thou? and thou ſaiſt, Oh, I ſeeke a Saviour, if you can tell me the way whereby mercy may be derived from him to my ſoule, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech you adviſe me of it; if you know the way how I may carry my ſelfe before
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:4399:76"/>
the Lord, that I may find mercy in his ſight let me know it. The truth is Chriſt is there, it is he that makes thee looke after a Chriſt, and it is Chriſt that makes thee ſeeke unto him for mercy; thou ſeekeſt to a Chriſt for a Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Secondly, as the ſoule of a poore ſinner knows not Chriſt though he meet him in his way, and out of the weakneſſe of his judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and by reaſon of his ignorance, hee knowes not his preſence: ſo in the ſecond place thou attendeſt not to the Lord Ieſus when he is come: therefore he comes meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and quietly, and calmely and ſpiritual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, notwithſtanding thou regardeſt him not. Chriſt came into the midſt of his Diſciples when all the doores were ſhut, and they attended not to him: ſo thou knoweſt not of a Chriſt, becauſe thou attendeſt not to him and his comming. Conſider this well: the maine hinderance is this, when the heart of a poore Chriſtian is marvellouſly taken aſide with his owne weakneſſe, and diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, and troubles, and his mind is all upon them, Chriſt paſſeth by and hee regardeth not: as <hi>Luke</hi> 24.5. when <hi>Mary</hi> came to ſeeke for Chriſt, the Angell ſaid to her, <hi>Why ſeeke you the living among the dead?</hi> So this hinders an humble ſoule from the know<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ledge of Chriſt: wee looke upon our cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions and rebellions, and rub the ſore
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:4399:76"/>
daily, and we thinke thus, can grace bee in ſuch a heart as this? and will the Lord dwel in ſuch a heart as this, thus vile, and thus peſtered with many baſe corruptions? Thou canſt never ſee him there. Why ſeekeſt thou a Chriſt to comfort thee, amongſt thy owne corruptions, that would hinder thee from ſeeing him, and from receiuing mercy from him? It was not for want of eyes that <hi>Hagar</hi> did not ſee the well, but becauſe ſhee did not ſearch for the Well: ſo it is with a poore ſoule.</p>
               <p>The well of life is in Chriſt, there is the fountain of all grace and mercy; the well is hard by us, nay it is within us: but alas we ſit like <hi>Hagars,</hi> and thus wee lye and periſh in our diſcouragements.<note place="margin">Simile.</note> If a man pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare for ſome great perſon, happely ſome King or deare friend, and one that he hath long looked for: if he comes not, then he gets him into a cloſe walke, and there hee ſits ſighing and mourning for his abſcence; and while he ſits thus, the man is come and hath beene long in the houſe before hee thinkes of any ſuch matter; and when he comes in, he begins to aske if the King or his friend be come. Oh, ſay they, hee is come long agoe: where have you bin? we wondred what was become of you. Iuſt ſo it is here: for when we are weldred in our owne ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, and thinke thus, Oh, when will it
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:4399:77"/>
once be? The ſoule lookes long for Chriſt to comfort him, and becauſe hee receives not comfort, he goes into the dungeon of deſperate diſcouragements: and then the Lord Ieſus comes to refreſh that ſoule, though hee perceives it not.<note place="margin">Simile.</note> A man may ſit long in a darke cellar or dungeon before he can ſee when the Sun comes into the houſe and ſhines there: but let him come from the cellar, and then he ſhall ſee the Sun ſhine cleerely. So when the Son of righteouſneſſe ſhines into a man, and reveales himſelfe, he gets him downe into his diſtempers, and wil not looke to a Saviour; the Son of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe is come and ſhines, and hee per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiues it not. And as <hi>Phillip</hi> ſaid, <hi>Iohn</hi> 14.8. <hi>Shew us the Father and it ſufficeth.</hi> Then <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus ſaith unto him, have I beene ſo long a-time with you, and yet haſt thou not knowne me? he that hath ſeene me, hath ſeene the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:</hi> he deſireth to ſee the Father, and yet when hee ſeeth Chriſt, he ſeeth the Father. So it is with this bleſſed frame of ſoule: for when a poore ſoule mourns under the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then of ſin, and deſires that the word of God may prevaile with it, and take all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, then he deſireth to ſee Chriſt: this is the Spirit of Chriſt humbling, and break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and waking: it is the Spirit of Chriſt that makes you willing to part with ſinne. Hath Chriſt beene ſo long with you, and do you not know him?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="139" facs="tcp:4399:77"/>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> The third is, becauſe we judge Chriſts preſence by our owne ſenſe, and by ſome ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary ſweetneſſe that the ſoule ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins ſhould be with him if Chriſt were there. This is the nature of every poore creature: he ſets up a kind of imagination in his owne head, and thinkes if Chriſt were come once there would bee extraordinary ſweetneſſe and joy. Now ſetting up this imagination in his owne conceit, hee will heare no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther evidence if he cannot find this, and ſo miſ-judgeth the preſence of Chriſt. This was the failing of <hi>Gideon;</hi> for the ſpirit of Chriſt, came to him, and ſaid, <hi>The Lord is with hee, thou mighty man of valour. And Gideon ſaid, Oh my Lord, if the Lord be with us, why then is all this befallen us? and where be all his miracles that our Fathers told us of, ſaying, Did not the Lord bring us up from E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt? but now the Lord hath forſaken us, and delivered us into the hands of the Midianites Iudges</hi> 6.12.13. The Angell knew what he ſaid: but marke what he replies; And hee would not be perſwaded that the Lord was there, becauſe the enemy had the upper hand: he thought God was not preſent with them, becauſe the enemies were vexing them, and prevayling againſt them: but the argument was naught, for the Angell was certaine of that which he ſpake. Iuſt ſo it is for all the world with the poore
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:4399:78"/>
broken-hearted ſinner that now is oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with many corruptions. Sometimes when the faithfull miniſters ſpeake to them and ſay, Goe in peace you broken-hearted ſinners, the Lord is with you; Oh, ſay they, <hi>if the Lord were with us, why doth all this befall us?</hi> Why are our minds ſo igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, and our hearts ſo vile and ſinfull? and why are our corruptions ſo violent. Can the Lord be here and ſo many weakneſſes too? The Lord hath done great matters for them, that he hath done good too, and they have rejoyced with ioy vnſpeakeable and glorious: the Saints of God haue been more then conquerours through him that loved them, and have ſubdued their corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: but yet we are under the power of our ſinfull, poyſonfull, venemous hearts ſtill. Can the Lord bee with us, and all theſe abominations not onely preſſe in upon us, but even captive us? Yes, you miſtake the preſence of Chriſt, he is as well with you in the oppoſing of ſin, as in the over-comming thereof: therefore the argument is falſe. The ſame Apoſtle that was ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times more then a conquerour, was ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times led captive, as <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.23. and hee that did walke after the ſpirit of Chriſt, had the <hi>Fleſh luſting againſt the Spirit, and the Spirit againſt the Fleſh, Gal.</hi> 5.17. This is your imagination, that if once the King come to
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:4399:78"/>
your houſe, and keepe court, no Traitour muſt come there: yes, Traitours are ever where the court is, they follow the court; for there they thinke to accompliſh their villany. And you thinke if the King come to your houſe, he muſt hug you in his arms, and preſently promote you to all honors: ſo the ſoule ſaith, If Chriſt were with me, I ſhould have abilitie to doe my duty, and I ſhould have more power againſt corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Though whereſoever Chriſt is, there is ſight of ſin; yet this extraordinary ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe doth not follow: but becauſe they have not this, they thinke they have not Chriſt. It is juſt with the ſoule in this caſe, as if ſome Gentleman ſhould receive the King into his houſe,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> and yet he would not be perſwaded the King was come, becauſe he did not preſently ſend for him into the preſence chamber, and advance him to ſome great place of honour: he is there, though he will not preſently ſend for you. This was the fault of <hi>Thomas, Iohn</hi> 20.25. hee would haue tied the certainty of Chriſts reſurrection to his owne ſenſe, and if hee could not doe this, and that, he would not beleeue that Chriſt was riſen: for ſo the Text ſaith, the Diſciples all ſaw it, and did witneſſe it, but he confines all to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe of his owne ſenſe; except he could <hi>ſee in his hands the print of the nailes, and thruſt
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:4399:79"/>
his hand into his ſide,</hi> he would not beleeue Iuſt ſo it is for all the world with the poore humbled, broken ſoule: When a man de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends upon ſenſe and ſome ſtirring appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion: Oh, ſaith he, if I could ſee that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of Gods love, and had that aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, and if my heart could thus breake for my ſin, and if I had this ability with all care and cheerefulneſſe to all holy duties, then I could beleeue that Chriſt were come: this I told you before, you will not beleeue that the King is come to your houſe, except he will ſend for you preſently into his pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy chamber, and make you the favorite of the Kingdome. And therefore it befalls the ſoule of a poore ſinner as it did good old <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob, Gen.</hi> 45.26. his ſonnes told him that his ſonne <hi>Ioſeph was alive,</hi> but his <hi>heart did faint, for he could not beleeue it: but when hee ſaw the Chariots that his ſon had ſent for him, his ſpirit revived within him, and he ſaid, It is enough, Ioſeph my ſon is yet alive, &amp;c.</hi> Thus it is with us, we have the meſſengers of God, and the teſtimony of Scripture to confirme the preſence of Chriſt; but we will not beleeue except wee be charioted with that power and ability, and that feeling; and except you have your hearts fully ſatisfied according to your owne imaginations, you will not be perſwaded that Chriſt is come into your hearts.</p>

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> The fourth alſo is on our part. Bee it ſo that either we have abilitie to know a Chriſt and that we ſee his comming in, and that we doe not miſ-judge the preſence of Chriſt and doe not account of his comming by our owne ſenſe: yea, though wee were in the chamber of preſence, and have had much experience of Chriſts preſence with us; yet there is another hinderance which keeps off the poore ſoule, and that is, when our eyes bee hindred that wee cannot ſee Chriſt though he were before us: when the ſting of conſcience remaines, and the fierceneſſe of ſome temptaion preſſeth in upon us, or ſome worldly inconvenience ſits hard u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon us, and that our thoughts are wholly taken up with them, and the ſtrength of our imagination is wholly beſtowed vpon thoſe, how to prevent them, ſo that wee cannot ſee Chriſt: when a mans mind is thus wholly imployed, and all his thoughts thus buſied, partly about the guilt of ſin, how his conſcience may be quieted; and partly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout temptation, how it may be removed ſo that hee hath no leiſure to ſee Chriſt, though he knew him well if he were but in the calmneſſe of his heart: It befalls a poor ſoule in this caſe as it did the Diſciples that were going to <hi>Emmaus, Luke</hi> 24.16. for when Chriſt came and joyned ſides with them in their travels, and went with them,
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:4399:183"/>
the Text ſaith, that <hi>their eyes were holden that they ſhould not know him.</hi> See the ground of the holding of their eyes: Chriſt preſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted himſelfe in his owne proportion; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the fault was not in the ſubſtance that they did ſee. The fault was not in the eare, for that was not hindered in any meaſure; neither did Chriſt blind their eyes any way, for their eyes were thus farre opened, as to ſee the way, and walke cheerfully in it. What did hold their eyes then? leaving ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary things to God: it was this, their thoughts were ſo buſied about the death of Chriſt, and his reſurrection, that they did not know Chriſt though he were with them and therefore Chriſt asked them this queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;<note place="margin">Luke 24.17. &amp;c.</note>
                  <hi>What maner of communication is this that you have one to another, and are thus ſad? And the one of them ſaid to him, Art thou only a ſtranger in Ieruſalem, and haſt not knowne the things which are come to paſſe there in theſe daies? And hee ſaid unto them, What things? And they ſayd unto him, Concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Ieſus of Nazereth, which was a Prophet, mighty in deed, and word, before God, and all the people. We truſted that it had been hee which ſhould have redeemed Iſrael: and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide all this, to day is the third day ſince theſe things were done,</hi> and whether hee be riſen againe we know not. Wee find this by common experience, a man that hath his
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:4399:183"/>
mind poſſeſſed with ſome ſad meditation, though his familiar friend be neere him, yet he diſcernes him not: ſo the Diſciples ſaw not a Saviour though he were in their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence: therefore in the 32. verſe, when Chriſt had opened the Scripture, and revealed himſelfe to them, ſee what they ſaid, <hi>Did not our hearts burne within us, when hee talked with us?</hi> As if they ſhould ſay, Wee had pregnant teſtimonie enough of the divine preſence, but we had no eyes to ſee it: the burning of our hearts was argument enough that it was Chriſt that ſpake to us. So when the ſoule of a poore broken-hearted ſinner is taken up partly with the hurry of imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, partly with the violence of ſome temptation, and partly in regard of ſome worldly miſerie that falls upon it, it is ſo taken up with it, that it cannot ſee the Lord Ieſus Chriſt, though hee hath ſenſible expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience of Chriſt, and the heart burnes in love to Chriſt. This is the reaſon why ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny a poore ſoule, when Sathan lets flie at him, and ſome heavy temptation preſſeth in upon him, reveale never ſo many comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble promiſes, yet by reaſon thereof we find it by experience, that alwayes thoſe diſtreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed ſpirits forget whatſoever is ſpoken, &amp; all their mind and talk is upon the evill, and the violence of the temptation, and they attend not to the comfort, and to the promiſes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:4399:184"/>
to them: their eyes are held in this manner, that though they are neere to Chriſt, and even in the privie chamber, yet they will not take notice of Chriſt, becauſe their hearts are thus held off from the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion of his preſence. In <hi>Pſalme</hi> 73.23. when the Prophet <hi>David</hi> was fallen in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a deſperate perplexitie, becauſe of the proſperitie of the wicked, ſo that he began to queſtion his owne condition, at laſt hee ſaid, <hi>Nevertheleſſe, I am continually with thee: thou haſt holden mee by my right hand.</hi> He could not ſee Gods providence over him, and his preſence with him, becauſe his mind was ſo taken up with the proſperitie of the ungodly: he ſaw all their pompe, and their glory, and how <hi>their eyes ſtood out with fatneſſe,</hi> and that he was beaten every night: by reaſon hereof (I ſay) hee ſaw not God upholding of him, and going with him.</p>
               <p>So gather up the former paſſages; partly through ignorance, becauſe wee know not Chriſt when we ſee him, and partly through careleſneſſe, becauſe wee attend not to him when he is come, and partly becauſe we miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judge the preſence of Chriſt upon falſe grounds, and partly the eyes are hid by the hurry of ſome temptation, or ſome wordly extremity, that we cannot ſee Chriſt though he be with us: theſe be the firſt hinderances on our parts.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="147" facs="tcp:4399:80"/>And as it is thus with us,<note place="margin">And for three reaſons in Chriſt.</note> ſo there are other hinderances which let us that we cannot ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend a Chriſt; and they are theſe.</p>
               <p>Firſt, in generall; as we deprive our ſelves of conſolation in Chriſt, ſo the Lord Ieſus through our juſt deſerving doth withdraw himſelfe from us: As in <hi>Eſay</hi> 18.7. <hi>I will waite upon the Lord that hideth his face from the houſe of Iacob, and I will looke for him.</hi> And in <hi>Pſalme</hi> 31.22. <hi>I ſaid in my haſt, I am cut off from before thine eyes: nevertheleſſe thou heardeſt the voyce of my ſupplication, when I cried unto thee.</hi> Both theſe places doe make it cleere, that many times though the Lord Ieſus is neere the ſoule, yet he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends it not.</p>
               <p>Now the Lord Ieſus hides himſelfe upon three cauſes eſpecially.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> 1. When the Saints of God fall into ſome groſſe ſinne, and ſome ſcandalous of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, or elſe tamper with ſome boſome corruption, and are at truce with it, though it be but ſome infirmitie; then the Lord Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus juſtly hides himſelfe, and withdrawes the apprehenſion of his preſence from ſuch a ſoule. For theſe are the termes whereupon the Lord hath promiſed to reveale himſelfe, to wit, ſo farre as wee labour to walke with him. If the Saints of God fall off from him, and breake off themſelves, it is no wonder though the Lord Ieſus hide himſelfe from

them: he is with them while they are with him. No longer, no further doth Chriſt engage himſelfe to bee with us, but upon theſe termes. <hi>Iohn</hi> 14.21. <hi>Hee that hath my Commandements, &amp; keepeth them, he it is that loveth me, and he that loveth me, ſhall bee loved of my Father, and I will love him, and manifeſt my ſelfe to him,</hi> The Lord will ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt himſelfe to us: upon what grounds? If wee will love him and keepe his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements. But if we breake the conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on on our parts, and falſifie that wee have promiſed to doe, no wonder though the Lord withdraw himſelfe from us. You ſee it is the tenour upon which he promiſeth his preſence. Now if the Saints of God fall ſcandalouſly, and be overtaken with ſome groſſe ſin, this builds up the partition wall, that Chriſt cannot be diſcerned: as it was with <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 51.10. where hee ſaith, <hi>Create in mee a cleane heart, O God, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new a right ſpirit within me:</hi> hee was even to begin the world new againe. And it is Gods wiſe dealing with his owne ſervants: for God will not brooke ſinne in his owne ſervants: and they muſt know, if they will have him to dwell in them, they muſt not give way to any baſe ſinne, if they doe, hee will withdraw himſelfe from them: not that God forſakes finally whom hee loved once, but hee will take away the ſenſe and appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:4399:83"/>
of his preſence; that though he is there, yet the ſoule ſhall not ſee it. And alſo when they give way to ſome ſecret diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and are at truce with ſome infirmitie, and they will be parlying with it, and med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle too much with it, it is juſt with the Lord, and ordinary, to withdraw the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of his grace from ſuch a mans ſoule. If a Chriſtian be overtaken ſomewhat more than ordinary, with a peeviſh ſpirit, or if he be ſomething too eager for the world, ſo that hee grow cold in holy duties, and is in danger to lie and diſſemble for his gaine, it is juſt with God, that this man ſhould ſcramble for his comfort, and welter up and downe without any evidence of Gods love, And alſo though a Chriſtian commit not ſinne outwardly, yet if hee give leave to any ſinne, and beat truce with it, though they ſeeme to hate it, and yet let their medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations runne upon it, and parley with ſome ſecret imagination, &amp;c. it is juſt with God to hide himſelfe from them. And others there are that live with men, and ſee their evils, and yet will not reprove them. I have knowne many of thoſe to have gone out all their dayes without any comfort. And it is no marvell though they cannot ſee Chriſt, becauſe they themſelves build up the partition-wall betweene Chriſt and them: the Lord Ieſus Chriſt is not able to
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:4399:84"/>
brooke it, that hee is thus ſleighted and neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected, and that any ſinfull baſe diſtemper ſhould bee attended to, to keepe company with it rather than with Chriſt: Chriſt Ieſus diſtaſtes it infinitely, and therefore with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawes the apprehenſion of his preſence from ſuch a perſon.</p>
               <p>The ſecond cauſe why the Lord hides himſelfe, is, when the faithfull ſervants of God begin to grow careleſſe and luskiſh to holy duties; and becauſe God hath made knowne his good will to them, therefore they begin to grow careleſſe and ſecure. When the Lord ſeeth this, that they doe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſe his favour, ſo that now they begin to grow ſecure and heartleſſe, and to ſlag, and to grow ſluggiſh, it is juſt with the Lord to e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſtrange himſelfe from that ſoule, and it is juſt that that ſoule ſhould find himſelfe loſt, that hee may quicken up himſelfe. When Chriſtians grow cold in prayer, and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe in holy duties, the Lord taketh away the light of his favour, and hee leaves thoſe ſluggiſh hearts to themſelves: nay, God is forced even againſt his will and mind, even for the good of thoſe Chriſtians, to take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the comfort of his preſence: ſo that now they begin to thinke they never had grace. If the Lord did not thus, they would never mend their pace, nor quicken up them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to any holy duties. And this is the
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:4399:84"/>
reaſon why many lie downe in ſorrow, and thinke they never had any grace at all: the Lord ſeeth it, and perceives it, that unleſſe he ſhould bring them to this extreme haz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard, they would never be drawne out from that deſperate ſecuritie: but by this meanes in the end God makes them find their hearts and tongues againe, and makes them conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der from whence they are fallen. Oh, ſaith the Lord, mercy is as good when you have it, as when you want it; the time was, when you filled heaven and earth with your pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and you could pray earneſtly, and you could give the Lord no reſt; you prized opportunities, and now you have many op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities and ſlight them. It is juſt with God, when we begin to be thus tongue-tied, and to be ſecure, and to thinke all is wel (now the Lord hath humbled our ſoules, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned our ſinnes, and ſhewed us his favour) for a time to leave thoſe ſoules of yours, though he ſave you in the end: to ſend you a hell upon earth, that ſo you may ſtrive to receive that mercy and comfort which for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly you had, and now have ſleighted. Thus hee dealt with the Church in <hi>Cant.</hi> 5.2, 3. when Chriſt knocked at the doore, and ſaid, <hi>Open to mee, my ſiſter my love, my dove, my undefiled; for my head is filled with dew, and my lockes with the drops of the night:</hi> ſhe made anſwer in this manner, <hi>I have put off
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:4399:85"/>
my coat, how ſhall I put it on? I have wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed my feet, how ſhall I defile them?</hi> Now when Chriſt withdrew himſelfe, then ſhee found her feet againe, and followed Chriſt with much labour from place to place, and could not be content till ſhe had found him. And ſo it was with the holy Prophet,<note place="margin">Pſal. 30.6.</note> 
                  <hi>I ſaid in my proſperitie, I ſhal never be removed:</hi> but when he ſaw God going away from him, ſee how he beſtirres himſelfe:<note place="margin">2 Sam. 22.7.</note> 
                  <hi>Oh,</hi> ſaith hee, <hi>I cried to thee, O Lord, in the time of my trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</hi> Then he could pray, and heare againe, and recount Gods former goodneſſe, and performe his former duties.<note place="margin">Simile.</note> I have ſeene the father deale ſo with the child; when the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is going on in his journey, if the child will not go on, but ſtands gaping upon vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and when the father calls, he comes not, the onely way is this, the father ſteps aſide behind a buſh, and then the child runnes and cries, and if he gets his father againe, hee forſakes all his trifles, and walkes on faſter, and more cheerefully with his father than ever. So when the Lord Ieſus Chriſt ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times makes knowne himſelfe to us, and would carry us on in a Chriſtian courſe cheerefully, we are playing with trifles, and grow careleſſe, and cold, and worldly, and remiſſe in prayer, and dead-hearted; the onely way to quicken us up, is, to hide him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, and to make us give our ſelves for loſt;
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:4399:85"/>
and then they that could ſcarcely pray once a weeke, now will pray three or foure times aday.</p>
               <p>Thirdly and laſtly, the Lord doth hide himſelfe in his infinite wiſedome and father<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly care by way of prevention, that his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants and children might not fall into ſome evill. Hee will not beſtow the ſenſe and ſweetneſſe of his favour upon them, leſt they ſhould bee proud thereof, and pranke up themſelves in regard of their pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges, and bee carried with contempt of the weakneſſe of their fellow brethren: nay, if they had that which they deſired, there were no living with them: therefore the Lord in his care and goodneſſe is faine to hold them to hard-meat, and to keepe them to a ſpare diet. Hee ſeeth it ſutes beſt with the hearts of wayward ſinners; onely hee lets in ſome incklings of his favour and grace, and upholds the heart with ſo much mercy as may beare it up, and yet but with ſo much. Thus the Lord deales with us as a wiſe father doth with his child,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> hee ſeeth if he had his portion in his hands, he would be riotous and careleſſe, and therefore it is wiſedome not to truſt him with his eſtate, but to keepe him low, and to keepe him up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on dependance, that hee may have better ſubjection from his hands. So it is with the Lord, he ſeeth that wee have unruly hearts,
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:4399:86"/>
and that if wee had that evidence of Gods mercy made knowne to us that wee would have, we would be ſo proud, and ſo haugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and ſo full of contempt, and ſo cenſori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, that there were no living with us: ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord keepes us ſhort, and holds ſuch ſoules low, and keepes us only in ſome hope, to hold up our ſoules: and the more dependance the ſoule hath, the more obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance hath the Lord from us. Experience proveth it true, <hi>I have many things to write unto you;</hi> but you are not able to beare them now; you are not capable of them yet. As it is with a little barke,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> if it ſhould have a great maine maſt, and broad ſaile cloathes, then in ſtead of carrying it, it would bee o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthrowne by them: therefore men propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion their maſt according to their ſhippe or barke; and if it have skilfull Mariners, they ſtrike ſaile when they come into the ſhallow or narrow Seas. This is the reaſon why the Lord deales ſo with us: the ſoule is like the ſhip, and the ſenſe of Gods love and mercy is like the ſaile that carries us on in a Chriſtian courſe: and if we get but a little ſaile of mercy and favour, we goe on ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and comfortably; but if God give us a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boundance of aſſurance, our curſed rotten hearts, would overturne, and in ſtead of quickning of us, it would ouerthrow us: ſo that though God doth it the fault is in our
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:4399:86"/>
ſelues. That I take to bee the ground, why many a poore Saint of God hath ſmoaked out his dayes in doubting and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king queſtion of Gods mercy and goodnes and at the houre of death God hath given them a full aſſurance of mercy,<note place="margin">Note.</note> and ſo car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried them full ſaile to heaven: they were not able to beare this before. As a faithfull Miniſter of God once ſaid to a poore woman that had beene long time queſtioning her ſelfe, and doubting of her ſalvation, when at laſt the Lord made it good unto her ſoule that Chriſt was her owne, then the Miniſter ſayd to her, The Lord will not alwayes giue his children a cordiall, but he hath it ready for them when they are fain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting. The comfort of Gods ſpirit is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>then wine, Cant</hi> 1.2. Now when a man hath a proud, haughty, ſelfe-conceited heart, if he had much of this cordiall, hee would forget himſelfe, and trample upon every one; and therefore the Lord reſerues this great mercy to the laſt: this deprives a Chriſtian of abundance of ſweetneſſe, that otherwiſe God would beſtow upon him. Let every man therefore goe to his owne heart, and examine it; if while God is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to keepe us under hatches, and to knock off our wheeles, and leaue us in the duſt, if yet in the meaneſt degree we can ſnarle with Gods providence, and ſay, Why do I pray,
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:4399:87"/>
and God anſwers not? others crie, and God heareth them, and why doth hee not heare me?

               <p>So then, gather up all, and the ſumme is this; If wee have not the apprehenſion of Chriſts preſence with us, though hee is there, then either it is becauſe of our owne ignorance or careleſneſſe wee know him not, or attend not when hee comes; or elſe we miſ-judge the preſence of Chriſt; and onely eſteeme of his favour and preſence according to the extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſweetneſſe that we would haue, and that wee imagine ſhould accompany the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of Chriſt; or elſe becauſe our eyes are held with the hurry of ſome temptation, and ſome worldly inconvenience, that wee cannot ſee the Lord Chriſt though hee bee within us; or elſe the Lord juſtly hideth himſelfe from us, becauſe we are fallen in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſome groſſe ſinne, or elſe parly with ſome

told you before that the ingraffing of the ſoule into Chriſt, is nothing elſe, but when the Lord by his Spirit comes to take poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the humbled ſoule: ſo that the ſoule ſtands poſſeſſed of Chriſt, and is made par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taker of all thoſe ſpirituall good things that are in Chriſt. This is generall to all the workes of application of Chriſt, and the footſteps are to be ſeene in all the workes of of vocation, juſtification, adoption, ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, and the like: the Lord Ieſus gets ground in the heart by all theſe. As, in vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, the Lord drawes the ſoule to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, and the ſoule followes him; in juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation the Lord undertakes for the ſinner, and unites the ſoule to himſelfe, and makes it one with himſelfe; in adoption the Lord makes him a ſonne, and in ſanctification he ſets a ſtampe upon him: but in all ſee and conſider there is poſſeſſion, ſo that this worke of poſſeſſing the ſoule is generall to all, and ſo is fit for this place. See how fitly it ſuits to the worke of preparation: the ſinner reſignes himſelfe into the hands of the Lord, and he falls downe before his footſtoole, and lets the Lord doe what hee will with him; and when the ſoule is come to this, the Lord Chriſt comes immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately and takes poſſeſſion of him, and doth ingage himſelfe to provide for him.

I told you formerly, that when God opened the ſinners eyes, and hee hath ſeene his ſinne truly and throughly, and is pierced with horror in the apprehenſion of his ſinne, and he finds it to be the greateſt vexation that can befall him; the ſinner is weary of his corruptions, and deſires to be freed from them: but hee hath no power of himſelfe, as from himſelf and therefore the ſoule in this horrour of heart dares not meddle with ſinne, yet hee cannot free himſelfe from the power of it.

Now the ſoule groanes under all theſe, and ſaith, Oh, who will deliver me? Then the Lord Ieſus comes into reſcue him: and when the heart is content to bee freed from ſinne, Chriſt makes anſwer ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Be thou comforted thou poore bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken hearted ſinner, I will undertake for thee, and I will ſatisfie Gods divine juſtice,

Firſt, for divine juſtice: the ſoule ſeeth a holy God, that will not put up the wrong that hath beene done againſt him, but will have his glory here in his humiliation, or elſe in his confuſion hereafter. Now when divine juſtice makes out againſt a poore ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, the Lord Ieſus Chriſt comes in and puts in baile for him:<note place="margin">Simile.</note> As it is with a man that is arreſted, by the Sergeant, he may haue this liberty, to put in a baile; ſo when the wrath of the Almighty drinkes up a mans ſpirits, and dragges downe his ſoule to hell in his owne apprehenſion, then the Lord promiſeth the poore ſoule to ſee all ſatisfied. Comfort your ſelves you broken hearts, the Lord Chriſts baile will be taken for more debts then you owe: nay, the Father de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires no better ſurety; as hee himſelfe ſaith, <hi>Mat.</hi> 3.13. <hi>This is my beloved Sonne, in whom I am well pleaſed:</hi> hee doth not ſay with whom I am well pleaſed, but in whom, that is, in him, and all that come to God the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in his name. Thus the Lord Ieſus Chriſt doth, and ſo a ſinner is freed from that wrath of the Almighty. Secondly, the power of Satan is cruſhed, ſo that he ſhall never more
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:4399:91"/>
bee able to bee Lord and Ruler over the ſoule truely humbled: but whereſoever the Lord Ieſus Chriſt comes, Satan gives way to the ſupreame authority of the Lord Chriſt; and the Lord Ieſus makes all to vaniſh, and no more to appeare or have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing to doe in the heart: as hee him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe ſaith in <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.18. <hi>I have the keys of Hel and of death.</hi> You know that he that hath the keyes doth all, he opens and ſhuts, he lets in and puts out whom he will: ſo the Lord Chriſt hath the ſupreame command over hell and death, and he can unlocke hell gates and bring out from the gates of death any poore ſinner that is wronged by Satan: and therefore when the Lord Ieſus Chriſt aroſe he led captivity captive, as a valiant tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphant Conquerour leades a company of poore captives. Now then Chriſt having conquered hell and death, whereſoever he comes, Sathan gives way, and dares not meddle there any more: Therefore Chriſt ſaith in <hi>Luke</hi> 10.11. <hi>I ſaw Sathan fall downe from heaven like lightning,</hi> that is, when the Scepter of Chriſt was ſet up in the Goſpel, then the Devill that cruell tyrant fel down on a ſudden, and was faine to give way, and not to lay claime to the heart. Thus ſinne is ſhaken off, and comes to bee caſheered from that ſoule for whom Chriſt hath undertaken. Sin as it were challengeth pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:4399:91"/>
to the ſoule; but Chriſt having ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken poſſeſſion, he ſatisfieth all quarrels and beares all the charges of whatſoever ſinne makes againſt the ſoule; and when ſin ſaith I have had a poſſeſſion of his ſoule from his very birth to this day, and why ſhould I goe out now? then the Lord Ieſus ſaith, the iſſue is out: and thus ſin challengeth a right to the heart, but Chriſt ſaith it is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given. And therefore though ſin be never ſo violent, yet the Lord Ieſus ſaith, that ſoule is mine, and was created by mee for my owne glory; and howſoever ſinne hath crept in, yet now depart, I am come to take poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.3. there the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>What the Law could not doe, in that it was weake through the fleſh, God ſending his owne Sonne in the likeneſſe of ſinfull fleſh, and for ſinne condemned ſinne in the fleſh:</hi> The phraſe that fits our purpoſe, is this, the Lord Chriſt <hi>condemned ſinne.</hi> The judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Calvin</hi> is this, To condemne ſinne in the fleſh is nothing elſe but thus; as it is with a man that is in law, when the cauſe goes againſt a man, and hee is caſt in that he laid claime to, we uſe to ſay hee is condemned. Sinne layeth a kind of claime to the ſoule of a poore ſinner, and claimeth a kind of right, upon theſe grounds: Every ſonne of <hi>Adam</hi> is a child of diſobedience, and ſo the child of wrath: But that man is
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:4399:92"/>
a child of <hi>Adam,</hi> and therefore the child of diſobedience, and conſequently death and damnation is due to that man, and here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon hee is mine. Now Chriſt anſwers all theſe pleas of ſinne, and makes ſin fall off from the cauſe, and ſaith, It is true that thoſe that are charged with the ſinne of <hi>Adam,</hi> and are under the power of that cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption which they receive from <hi>Adam,</hi> they are the children of diſobedience, and ſo no wonder though they are ſubject to wrath. He grants all this, but yet ſaith hee, They for whom the ſinne of <hi>Adam</hi> hath bin ſatisfied, and from whom the guilt of it removed, and they for whom Chriſt hath conquered ſinne, they ought not to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, for they are delivered from this wrath: but ſuch is this humble ſoule for whom I have undertaken. Is the ſinne of <hi>Adam</hi> imputed? I have ſatisfied for it: doth the ſinne of <hi>Adam</hi> prevaile againſt him? by my death I have overcome ſinne and hell, and hee ſhall haue the benefit of my victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie. Now ſinne falls off from the claime and loſeth the day. If the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> hath ſinned againſt God, the ſecond <hi>Adam</hi> hath ſuffered: if the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> hath polluted the ſonnes of men, the Lord Ieſus by the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of quickning, hath ſubdued the power of corruption, ſo that neither the guilt of ſinne can be imputed, nor the power of ſinne pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:4399:92"/>
againſt the poore ſinner for whom Chriſt undertaketh.</p>
               <p>So then it is plaine that the Lord Ieſus un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakes for the ſoule, and provides for it, as in all the three particulars: this is the firſt particular of the poſſeſſion.</p>
               <p>
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſ. </seg>2</label> Secondly, Chriſt doth diſpoſe of the ſoule for his beſt advantage. This is one ſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that a man will diſpoſe all his occaſions for his owne convenience, for his owne be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoofe, ſo farre as may be for his owne bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit and comfort. So when the Lord Ieſus Chriſt comes to take poſſeſſion, he will have the rule and command of the heart: But when Satan that ſtrong man armed keepes the houſe, and ſinne rules in the ſoule (in a mans naturall condition) and that the ſoule is at their managing, and at their framing and teaching, it either lyes barren and fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, or elſe brings forth nothing but thornes and thiſtles; as in <hi>Ier.</hi> 4.3. <hi>Breake up the fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low grounds</hi> of your hearts, <hi>and ſow not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong thornes:</hi> for the ſoule naturally being ruled by ſinne, is overſpread with thornes, and is altogether corrupt and deteſtable, and Satan and ſinne rule in the heart and affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: ſo that now the whole frame of the ſoule bringeth out fruits of darkneſſe to Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan. And hence it is that the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.20. <hi>When yee were the ſervants of ſin, yee were free from righteouſneſſe;</hi> that is,
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:4399:93"/>
when yee were under the power of ſinne, yee did not worke for God, yee did all to ſatisfie your owne luſts: the drunkard is free from the power of ſobriety, and the thiefe is free from the power of juſtice, and ſo the graces of Gods Spirit rule not in a man. But now when the Lord hath (by the power of his grace) bound the ſtrong man, and caſt him out by contrition and humiliation, then hee takes the ſoule, and it is in the hands of the Lord Ieſus Chriſt, and hee diſpoſeth of it, ſo as may bee for the comfort of the ſoule, and for the furtherance of the glory of his rich grace. In <hi>Matth.</hi> 20.15. when the ſervants began to quarrell, becauſe they had but every man a penny, the Maſter ſaid, <hi>Is it not lawfull for me to do what I will with mine owne?</hi> ſo when the Lord hath caſt out cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, and ſaith, This heart, and this hand, and this tongue is mine, is it not lawfull for mee to doe what I will with them? This tongue ſhall praiſe my name, and ſhall never ſpeake vainly and fooliſhly, and this heart ſhall love me, and this hand ſhall worke for mee, I will diſpoſe of all for the advantage of my great name.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Three wayes Chriſt diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth the heart to himſelfe.</note>This the Lord makes knowne in three particulars; for wee keepe our ſelves to the generall, that wee may not incroach upon thoſe particular workes which are to follow: I ſay, there are three particular acts upon the ſoule.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="169" facs="tcp:4399:93"/>Firſt, the Lord Ieſus fits the ſoule for his ſeruice, which otherwiſe is altogether unfit for any ſpirituall ſervice; the Lord Ieſus puts thoſe ſpirituall abilities into the ſoule, which may make it fit for Gods turne, ſo that it is now a fit patterne to expreſſe the riches of his grace in Chriſt Ieſus: As it is with a man that hath paſſed over ſome part of his poſſeſſion into the hands of ſome pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digall ſonne,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> or ſome naughty tenant, and the land is out of heart; when he taketh poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of it againe, he will be ſure to order it that it may be fit for uſe; he will digge and dung and manure it, that ſo hee may expect ſome fruit from it: juſt ſo it is with every ſinner, he lies lay, and that wretched heart of his never deſired any good, and his looſe tongue never ſpake any good, it lay fallow, and it brought forth nothing but baſe practices, but when ſinne and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than hath driven the ſoule out of heart, that it hath no power to doe any good, then the Lord Chriſt comes and takes poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the heart, hee taketh it in from the common of the world, and he manureth it with the grace of his ſpirit, as it is in that phraſe, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.16, Thou art partaker of the roote and fatneſſe of the Olive tree. Though it were a barren minde, and a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and corrupt heart, and a wanton eye the Lord hath taken theſe parts of the body
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:4399:94"/>
and ſoule, and mannured them, and convai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth ſuch fatnes and grace, that the ſoule be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes fit to doe him honour, and to receiue comfort from him.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, as the Lord fits the ſoule for his ſervice, ſo he maintains that fitneſſe and that gracious diſpoſition of ſoule and ſpirit whereſoever he hath beſtowed it; ſo that the ſoule, if it be not negligent of its owne ſalvation, cannot loſe that fitneſſe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together, and the Lord Ieſus cannot loſe that glory which hee expects from it: as in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16.5. <hi>The Lord is the portion of mine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance, and of my cup, thou maintaineſt my lot.</hi> The Lord Ieſus allowes a portion of grace to every ſoule that hee comes in, and he maintaines that grace.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Laſtly, he doth improue that fitneſſe for the praiſe of his great name; the Lord Chriſt ever receives ſome in-come of ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice and obedience, and that ſoule ever re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives ſome comfort and conſolation from him. This is the difference betweene the firſt and ſecond <hi>Adam:</hi> the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> had grace, but hee neither kept it nor improved it aright, he did not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove that wiſedome which God had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven him to repell the temptations of Satan and he did not improue his ſtrength and ability to keepe him from falling from God but when the Lord Ieſus comes to take
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:4399:94"/>
poſſeſſion of a poore ſoule, he will not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly keepe and maintaine the grace that hee hath given him, but he will quicken it, and provoke that ſoule to doe what hee ſhould doe in all obedience, and to receive what comfort the Lord hath in ſtore for him. See this in ſome paſſages of Scripture: <hi>Ioh.</hi> 15. 1, 2. <hi>I am the true vine, and my Father is the husbandman. Every branch in me, that beareth not fruit, he taketh away: and every branch that beareth fruit, he purgeth it, that it may bring forth more fruit.</hi> Every poor Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, every poor woman, and every poore Apprentice and little childe, whom God hath called, ſhall beare fruit, hee purgeth them, and ſo the Lord receives ſome im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of his graces, that he gives to thoſe that he takes poſſeſſion of.</p>
               <p>So then, let us gather up all; If the Lord Ieſus undertakes for the ſoule, ſo that juſtice cannot proceed againſt him; and if he doth diſpoſe of the ſoule, and fit it for his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, and maintain that fitneſſe, and improue it for his glory; then certainely hee doth take ſupreme poſſeſſion of the ſoule: and he that undertakes for the ſoule takes poſſeſſion of the heart.</p>

Oh, woe to us, that we have ſuffered the Lord Ieſus Chriſt to deſire entertainement, and yet would not receive him: we have taken notice of him, but wee would none of him. Who rules in that heart? The old Tyrant, the old luſt and corruption, as pride and covetouſneſſe theſe beare rule every where, both in the cloſet and at the table: the husband and the wife, and all are proud; theſe will not out but retaine their hold there ſtill. And pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fanenes,
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:4399:95"/>
and contempt of God and his ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, this is the tyrant that rules in many families, and in every coaſt in our land. The father ſwears, and the child ſweares; the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter reviles Gods Miniſters, and the ſervant knows the length of his Maſters foot, and hee railes too, and the child heares it and followes the ſame courſe. If theſe beare rule in you, the Lord Ieſus Chriſt is farre from you. May I not complaine as ſometime <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remiah</hi> did? <hi>Ier.</hi> 17.13. when the Lord was going from the people, the holy prophet looks longly after him, and ſaith, <hi>O Lord the hope of Iſrael, why art thou as a waifairing man?</hi> So may wee not iuſtly complain and ſay, Oh that Chriſt ſhould come and offer himſelfe and not be regarded? When the Divell ſhall drag downe your ſoules to hell and deſtruction, then you will cry after him, and ſay, Oh thou the hope of Iſrael, why doſt thou depart. In <hi>Gen.</hi> 19.2. when the two Angels came to <hi>Lot in Sodome</hi> (the one was Chriſt) <hi>Lot</hi> compelled them to go in. Chriſt is not now unwilling, but hee knockes and calls, and ſaith, <hi>Open to me my love, my dove my undefiled:</hi> he entreats the looſe perſon to forſake his baſe practiſes, and the covetous perſon to leave his oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and to receive mercy: but you ſuffer Chriſt to lye in the ſtreet; and deſpiſe that word of his, and will bee at your owne car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving.
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:4399:96"/>
This eſpecially falls foule upon two ſorts of perſons.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> The firſt ſort is all carnal profane oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers of the Lord Ieſus. The carnall Goſpel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler is content that Chriſt ſhould undertake for him, and bee his Protectort, to defend him from the plague of ſin; but he is not content that Chriſt ſhould rule in him. He doth as the Inne-keeeper, that receives a gueſt into his houſe, to make an advantage of him: for as the Inne-keeper will come to his gueſt, and pretend great matters to him, not becauſe he would have his gueſt to poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſe him, but becauſe hee would bee poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſor of his money; ſo the carnall Goſpel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler would have Chriſt for his owne turne, hee would diſpoſe of Chriſt and mercy for his owne purpoſe: and hence come all thoſe ſpeeches, God is mercifull, and, Hath the Lord Chriſt created men to damne them? Oh, but mercy is ſweet, and pardon is good. This is thus much, you would have Chriſt to pardon ſinne, that you might commit it with leſſe feare and more freedome. If you did ſee no Saviour, but that you muſt needs be damned for it, you would ſtartle at it. But you would have Chriſt to ſtand by you that you might ſinne the more freely. Oh be not deceived; doe you thinke that Chriſt will come to be an underling to your luſts, and a drudge to your baſe diſtempers, whoſe
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:4399:96"/>
condemnation is iuſt, ſaith the Apoſtle? No, you are deceived, you ſhall not have Chriſt a ſervant to carry your luſts and pleaſures to heaven with you. The truth is, the Lord Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus will never bring comfort nor conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to thee, that wilt not bee poſſeſſed of him, either haue both or neither, chuſe whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you will.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> The ſecond ſort to be reproved, are a company of ſlie hypocrites, that would part ſtakes with Chriſt, and part houſes with him they could bee content that hee ſhould have ſome roome in the houſe, but they will diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of all themſelues: as a man that lets ſome roomes in his houſe,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> upon this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, that he may have them when he liſts. You willl pray againſt ſinne, provided that now and then Chriſt will give you leaue to practiſe it; and you will cry out againſt it, provided that you may have a privy ſeale, or ſome ſecret licence for it; and you will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe bitterly againſt baſe courſes, ſo you may haue ſome backe doore and inward luſt ſtill. The Lord Ieſus doth not ſhare with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny man: can he have a part and the Divell a part? nay, hee will have either all or none. It was the tricke of an adulterous heart: for when there was contention for the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, the harlot ſaid,<note place="margin">1 King 3.26.</note> 
                  <hi>Let it be neither thine nor mine, but divide it:</hi> Nay ſaith the mother, <hi>let her have all.</hi> Shee was the harlot,, that
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:4399:97"/>
would have the child devided.</p>
               <p>So it is with an adulterous and diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling heart, that ſaith, Let Chriſt have a part, and the world a part; let luſts and pompe have a part, and Chriſt a part, this is diſſimulation with GOD, and ſhall receive condemnation: there muſt bee no ſharing. If your hearts be guilty of this I charge you in the name of the Lord Ieſus conſider it, the Lord never came into your ſoules: you muſt reſigne all to him, and then he will ſaue all: he will pardon all ſin, and give power againſt it. What a fearfull thing were it, if the Lord ſhould deale with you as you deale with him? Suppoſe thou couldſt be halfe damned; wouldſt thou be content to have thy heart go to hell, and thine eye to heaven, or thy body to hell, and thy ſoule to heaven? therefore that thy bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and ſoule may both be ſaved, reſigne up up all into the hands of thy Saviour, and let him diſpoſe of all here in the kingdome of grace, and then he will take all to himſelfe in glory for ever.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vſe</hi> 2. If the Lord Ieſus be the poſſeſſor of all the houſe, then let every one haue his owne,<note place="margin">Give all to Chriſt whoſe it is.</note> doe not with draw from Chriſt that which is his. Whoſe image and ſuperſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion hath the ſoule? Chriſt Ieſus hath the protection of it, therefore let him have all. Let thine eye ſee his works and wonder and
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:4399:97"/>
admire at them: let thy minde know Ieſus Chriſt, whom to know is eternal life; but do not withdraw any thing from the true ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner therof, that hath purchaſed it full deare. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.15. <hi>Shall I take the members of Chriſt, and make them the members of an harlot? God forbid.</hi> Thine eye, and thy tongue, and thy hand, and thy heart, they are all Chriſts members, he hath bought all with his blood and thou haſt nothing to do with that which Chriſt hath bought: therefore whenſoever thy corruptions ſtirre, and Satan tempts and begges for the uſe of thy mind or heart make anſwer and ſay: Shall I take that heart that is Chriſts, and thinke baſely? God forbid: Shall I take the hand of Chriſt, and worke wickedneſſe with it? The holy Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle is marvellous peremptory in this caſe: as 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.19. <hi>Glorifie God in your body and in your ſpirit, which are Gods,</hi> and hee hath bought you with a price: your bodies and ſoules are the Lords, hee undertakes for both, therefore glorifie God in both. If a man did come to your houſe, and take the meat and drinke that you have provided, and rob you of your money, you would take it very hardly, and ſay, It is my owne: So, you are not your owne. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if the Divell or the world would pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile with you, and enter into the uſe of your heart or minde, tell him they are not

<pb n="180" facs="tcp:4399:99"/>
All is his fruit in us. At this time of loue and joy.</p>
               <p>The point of Doctrine is this.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Love and joy by the ſpirit wrought in a broken heart, for embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing mercy as it deſerves.</note>
                  <hi>Doct.</hi> The Spirit of the Father kindles in the ſoule of a ſinner, truly humbled and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightned, love and joy, to entertaine and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce in the riches of his mercy, ſo as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeemes the worth of it. There are three paſſages conſiderable, that wee may know the meaning of this Doctrine.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, this love and joy is no where to be found nor ſeene, but <hi>onely in a heart hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled and inlightned:</hi> For unleſſe the heart be humbled, it ſeeth no need of this grace and mercy, and therefore deſpiſeth it, and is ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther carried with a hatred againſt that grace and mercy that would purge him; and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled with a kind of wearineſſe of the power of that grace that would reforme his life and converſation. And though hee were hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, yet if he were not enlightned to ſee this mercy and goodneſſe of God, he cannot de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in it. I know there is wilde love and joy enough in the world, as there is wilde Thyme and other herbes, but wee would have garden-love and garden-joy, of Gods owne planting: for ſuch hypocriticall love and joy we will not meddle with here.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, this love and joy is kindled <hi>by the Spirit of the Father;</hi> for the Father learnes us the lecture, and (as I told you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:4399:99"/>
of the mind inlightned) kindles this ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fire, which is rightly compared to the fire of the Sanctuary, as in <hi>Lev.</hi> 9.24 <hi>There came a fire from before the Lord, and conſumed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Altar the burnt offering;</hi> even thoſe ſparkes of the pillar of fire which did typi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie Chriſt to them. But whether this bee ſo or no, I will not now diſpute, for as the Lord provided the ſacrifice, ſo the Lord cauſed the fire to come downe from heaven: and hence it was that when <hi>Nadab</hi> and <hi>Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hu</hi> offered ſtrange fire, the Lord conſumed them, <hi>Lev.</hi> 10.1, 2. ſo it is in this holy fire of love and joy, wee may ſtrike and ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, but our ſteele and our flint will not worke this indevour, nor ſtrike this fire of love and joy. It is Ieſus Chriſt from whence all ſpirituall ſparkes of grace doe come, and amongſt the reſt theſe of love and joy; all other love and joy, that is not wrought by the Spirit of the Father, muſt be caſheered and abandoned, it cannot reach to God, nor be pleaſing unto him: It is that which the Apoſtle inferres in the generall, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.8. <hi>They that are in the fleſh, cannot pleaſe God;</hi> but it muſt be joy of the ſpirit, which muſt pleaſe him. Now though the ſoule truely humbled and broken, that here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore hath felt the weight and burden of his ſinnes, and is now ſeparated from them, ſo that hee dares not meddle with them, hee
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:4399:100"/>
dares as well take a Beare by the tooth, and fall quicke into hell, as take up thoſe courſes againe, yet hee hath not power of himſelfe to bee enlarged in any love to entertaine Chriſt, or ſpiritually to joy in him, further than the power of the Lord Ieſus in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe ſhall inable him thereto. Suffer me to inlarge my ſelfe thus: The ſoule is like an empty veſſell, it ſtands not at the diſpoſe of ſinne, or it ſelfe, but it is at the Lords diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition; if the Lord will kindle any love and joy, ſo it is, for of himſelfe hee cannot doe it. As it is with ſome Gentleman in the Countrey,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> he will be content to let the King have the uſe of his houſe for a while, but he is not able to provide neceſſaries for him, becauſe hee is a meane man, therefore the King ſends his proviſion before, and then comes himſelfe: Iuſt ſo it is here with a poore humble broken-hearted ſinner; the poore ſoule is marvellous well content that the Lord ſhould come and dwell in him, and diſpoſe of him, but hee is not able to give him any entertainment: he hath not any heat of holy affections, or love, or deſire, to wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the Lord as becomes ſo great a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſtie: therefore the Lord is faine to infuſe love and joy, that by them he may bee wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commed into the ſoule of the humbled ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. Now when the ſoule is come to this degree of ſanctification, then it can worke
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:4399:100"/>
by it ſelfe. Or thus:<note place="margin">Simile.</note> It is with a broken-hearted ſinner, as with a burning glaſſe; take ſuch a glaſſe, it will burne any thing by the heat of the Sunne, yet it hath no heat in it ſelfe, but receives it from the Sun-beames, by vertue whereof it burnes whatſoever is before it: Iuſt ſo it is with a broken-hearted ſinner. But all ſtubborne ſinners are like water, that will not burne at all. I will goe no further than the worke of preparation. It is neither ſinne nor ſelfe ſhall have power over mee, ſinne ſhall not, and ſelfe cannot rule me: therefore I will wait till the Sunne of righteouſneſſe will ſhine forth from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, from the beavtie of his ſanctuary; and having received the beames of Gods love and favour effectually upon my ſoule, and being warmed by the Sunne of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, I ſhall be able to returne the heat of love to God againe. Thus the Spirit of the Father kindles love and joy in a heart hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled and inlightned.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, the Doctrine ſaith, that loue and joy are kindled, <hi>that they may entertaine and rejoyce in the riches of Gods mercy, in the worth of it.</hi> This laſt clauſe is added to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover the diſtinct nature of this love and joy, from all the fained love and joy, that all carnall and hypocriticall wretches pretend to have to Ieſus Chriſt; there is a kind of loving and joying in the hearts of hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites,
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:4399:101"/>
as afterward you ſhall heare: So ſayes <hi>Iudas, Haile Maſter;</hi> ſo the Phariſees and the people cut downe branches of the trees to welcome Chriſt, and crid, <hi>Hoſanna, Bleſſed is hee that commeth in the name of the Lord.</hi> And in <hi>Matth.</hi> 8.19. <hi>A certaine Scribe came, and ſaid unto him, Maſter, I will follow thee whitherſoever thou goeſt.</hi> And ſo the ſtony ground, <hi>Matth.</hi> 13.20. did heare the Word with joy; and ſo love and joy goe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether: But it is not that kind of love which came downe from Heaven, nor that which will ever carrie your ſelves as beſeeming the mercie of God in Chriſt; for hee that ſaid, <hi>Haile Maſter,</hi> betrayed his Maſter with a kiſſe: and Chriſt might have ſaid, Is this thy love and joy wherewith thou welcommeſt me? And the Scribes and Phariſees follow Chriſt a while, and then forſake him; and ſo they that before cried, <hi>Hoſanna, Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed is he that commeth in the name of the Lord,</hi> within a while after they cry, <hi>Crucifie, cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie him;</hi> and the ſtony ground received the Word with joy, and a while after came to nothing. This is wild-fire, and fooliſh fire, as the Philoſopher ſaith, it is bred and ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mered out by our owne ends and aimes; but they doe not carrie themſelves beſeeming the riches of Gods free grace in Ieſus Chriſt: that is thus; An heart thus kindled, beſtowes the beſt love and joy upon the Lord Ieſus
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:4399:101"/>
Chriſt, becauſe hee is the beſt good. This is the meaning of that phraſe ſo often inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated, <hi>Whoſoever loveth father or mother more than mee, is not worthy of mee.</hi> He that prizeth any thing more in love, or delights in any thing more with joy, than in Chriſt, is not worthy of Chriſt: So then, whoſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver beſtowes love or joy upon any carnall contents, more than upon Chriſt, his love and joy is not brought from Heaven, it is a falſe love that will fade, and will not bring him that comfort which hee lookes to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive from it. This love is called the ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall love, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.7. <hi>For God hath not gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven us the ſpirit of feare, but of power, of love, and of a ſound mind:</hi> wee have not received the ſpirit of bondage that is in preparation, but the ſpirit of love that is in vocation. It is called ſpirituall love, becauſe the Spirit of God in the promiſe kindles it, and joy goes with it, as you ſhall heare anon: and it is that affection alſo, in the example of <hi>Zacheus, Luke</hi> 19.6. hee had a moneths mind to ſee Chriſt, and (as the learned well interpret it) he had a blind deſire, but well ſet on by Chriſt; and therefore ſee how hee labours to preventall opportunities and occaſions: he runnes before the croude, and gets up in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a tree, and when hee was there Chriſt ſaw him, and ſaid, Come downe quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, for I muſt dine at thy houſe. Here
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:4399:102"/>
was the voyce of Chriſt, and the kindneſſe of Chriſt too, and this kindled the fire, and wrought love and ioy, for theſe two goe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether; and therefore the Text ſaith, <hi>Hee came downe and received him joyfully.</hi> This ſeemes to me to be the reaſon and meaning, why ſometimes in the phraſe of Scripture, love is put for beleeving, as in <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3.18, 19. <hi>Hee that beleeveth is not condemned, but hee that beleeveth not is condemned already, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he beleeveth not in the name of the onely begotten Sonne of God. And this is the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation, that light is come into the world, and men love darkneſſe more than light.</hi> The Text ſaith, He that beleeveth not, or he that receiveth not, for they are both one: hee proves this, that a man not beleeving ſhall be damned: why? for this <hi>is the great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation, that light is come into the world, and men love darkneſſe more than light:</hi> becauſe he will not love Chriſt, and will not receive him, he receives darkneſſe, and loves darkneſſe more than Chriſt, intimating the neere combination betweene theſe two, and the working and acting of them. There are many other places that ſpeake of love and ioy, but none that fits this place of voca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>Now to make this good, there are two things neceſſarie to bee propounded and handled:</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="187" facs="tcp:4399:102"/>Firſt, to ſhew the reaſon of the order of Gods worke, why after hope and deſire there comes this love and ioy.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the ground of this love, and what it is in the promiſe, that will kindle and ſtrike fire upon theſe two affections, and bring them home to the Lord; this being cleared, it will then appeare, how the Spirit of God in the promiſe doth kindle this love and ioy.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, for the former. What is the reaſon of the order of Gods worke?<note place="margin">Why after hope and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire God workes love and joy in the ſoule.</note> why comes love and ioy next after hope and deſire? I anſwer; There are but two affections, and there need no more (God being perfectly wiſe hath appointed it) whereby the ſoule ſhould ſend to meet with any good that is abſent: if the good be abſent, then the underſtanding ſaith, that is a good to be deſired, and very comfortable, oh that I had it: then it ſends out hope, and that waits for that good, and ſtayes till it can: ſee it: and if that good come not, then deſire hath another proper worke, it goes up and downe wandering, and ſeeking, and ſuing for Ieſus Chriſt, and this deſire goes from place to place, from Eaſt to Weſt, from North to South, &amp; ſaith, When ſhall I, and how may I come to the ſight of Ieſus Chriſt? As the Spouſe in the <hi>Canticles</hi> ſought to the watch-men to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire after Chriſt, ſo deſire wanders up and
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:4399:103"/>
downe. For ſo I told you, it is the wande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of the heart, and it never ceaſeth going and enquiring, if it can gaine any intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of Ieſus Chriſt. It goes to prayer, to ſee if it can ſpeake with Chriſt there; and from thence it goes to the Word, to ſee if that will reveale Chriſt; and to conference, if that will mention it, and ſaith, See you the Lord Ieſus Chriſt? The hungrie ſoule comes to the Church, to ſee if it can heare any newes of Chriſt: And thus it continues, till at laſt the Lord Ieſus Chriſt is pleaſed to come himſelfe, after the ſoule hath hungred for him, and ſought for him, as <hi>Marie</hi> ſaid: <hi>Oh if you can, tell me where my Lord is:</hi> So the ſoule goes from one place to another, from Prayer to the Word, and from the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament to Faſting, and asketh of the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, Where is my Saviour? and ſaith, If you know where hee is, tell me of him, that I may be poſſeſſed of him. After this, the Lord Ieſus Chriſt is pleaſed to come him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe into the view of the heart, which long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth thus after him, and ſaith as the Prophet, <hi>Behold, thy King commeth:</hi> So he ſaith, Oh thou poore broken-hearted ſinner, here is thy Saviour, hee is come downe from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven this day to ſpeake peace and comfort to thee, and thou that haſt ſo long time prayed; to thee he ſaith, Here I am, and all my me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits are now become thine, and to thee that
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:4399:103"/>
doeſt thus hunger and deſire Chriſt, hee is now come to comfort thee. Now when the Lord Ieſus Chriſt is come within thy view, and thy deſire hath met with him, then there comes the other two affections: he is come within ſight, and now there are other affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions ſtirred up, and ſent out by the Spirit of the Lord to give entertainment to Chriſt Ieſus. Love leads him into the ſoule, and tels the will of him, and ſaith; Loe here is Ieſus Chriſt, the Meſſiah, that hath ordered theſe great things for his Saints and people; and Ioy is the attendant to wait upon him, when he is come. Suffer me to expreſſe my ſelfe thus in this manner, becauſe I would ſhew the guiſe of the frame of the heart in this worke.</p>
               <p>It is with a poore humbled ſinner,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> as it is with a malefactour or traitor, who is purſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a Purſuivant, that hath laid wait for him as farre as the Sea, and at laſt hee is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to yeeld and come in. He hath offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded his Soveraigne, and hee is driven to a ſtand, he cannot procure a pardon, nor hee cannot eſcape; therefore hee is content to come in, and yeeld his necke to the blocke, that as he hath offended, ſo he may receive his puniſhment accordingly. Now as hee is going, he heares an inckling that there is ſome hope of a pardon, and thereupon the poore man begins to reioyce, in hope that
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:4399:104"/>
he may be pardoned; and then heareth o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther newes, which ſaith, if hee will but bee humbled before his Maieſtie, and come to the Court, and importune him for pardon, it is likely that he may be pardoned, nay it ſhall be ſo. Marry (ſaith he) that I will with all my heart; and ſo hee ſets forward, and comes to the Court: his deſire carries him thither. Thus it is (I ſay) with a poore ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner: hee is brought home to the Court, and about the Court hee attends, and askes for every man that comes forth, Did you not heare the King ſpeake of me? and, What doe you thinke of my caſe? At laſt ſome of the bed-chamber ſay to him, The King hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth that you are mightily humbled, and earneſtly deſire his favour, you ſhall heare more from him ere long. At laſt, the King himſelfe lookes out at a window, and ſaith, Is this the Traytor? Yes, this is he that hath beene humbled, and lyes at your mercy. Then the King calls out and ſaith, His par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don is drawing, and it is comming by and by, and ſo the King ſmiles on him. Oh then his heart leapes in his breaſt, and hee ſaith, The Lord preſerve your Grace, I thinke there was never ſuch a mercifull Prince knowne in the world. This is the love and delight that is ſtirred up. Now when the Pardon is ſealed and granted, then you ſhall ſee the worke of faith. A poore humbled
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:4399:104"/>
ſinner is this malefactor, that hath commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted high Treaſon againſt the God of heaven (for every ſinner hath rebelled againſt the God of grace.) The ſtubborne rebellious heart hath ſtood out againſt the Lord God, which is high Treaſon, though you little thinke it, when you goe on wilfully, and ſay, This man ſhall not rule over me. Well, bee humbled now in time, while you have mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy offered: for if you bee not humbled, the Lord ſhall ſend a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>aylor to take and throw you downe to Hell, and therefore you had better heare of it now than hereafter, when there is no remedie. Perhaps the Lord now purſueth a man with his heavie indignation, and lets flye at him, and ſets conſcience on worke to follow him, and to dogge him, ſaying, This is thy ſinne, and hell is thy por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to hell thou muſt. Now the ſoule be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing beſet with Gods wrath, in concluſion ſeeth hee cannot eſcape the Lords hands; and how to purchaſe mercy he knowes not, nor is it poſſible otherwiſe for him to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcape, and yet hee hath nothing to purchaſe mercy withall; therefore hee is content to lye downe before God, ſaying, I confeſſe I have ſinned, Oh Lord bee thou glorified, though I be damned for ever, my ſinnes are ſo many and ſo vile, I cannot almoſt deſire mercy, but if the Lord will, who can let him? Now when the heart is thus humbled,
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:4399:105"/>
then there comes a noiſe a great way off in the Miniſtery of the Goſpell, and that ſaith, Thy ſinnes are all pardonable: ſo he lookes up, and hope ſaith, Lord it may bee a dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned creature may bee recovered, a dead dogge may be reſtored to life, and a Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor may be pardoned &amp; receiued. Then the Lord ſends another comfortable meſſage, namely, That if thou canſt but ſee a need of mercy, and looke out and waite for him, thou ſhalt be pardoned: hereupon the peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent goes to the Court gate, that is, hee comes mourning to the Word, and ſaith, Oh yee faithfull Miniſters of God, you are of the bed-chamber, and you know Gods minde, I pray what doth God intend to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards me? Hereupon we that are the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of God, we tell him, your caſe is right, and happely if you attend upon God, you may heare more of him hereafter: for the Lord heares that you lye at the Court gate, and that you are exceedingly humbled; and thus farre deſire goes. At laſt the Lord Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt ſhewes and preſents himſelfe to the ſinner, and ſpeakes with him in the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery of the Word, and ſaith, That fainting, weary, loaden heart of thine ſhall bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhed, and then giveth him a looke of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, ſo that his heart danceth within him. (Still you muſt underſtand, that the Lord alwayes ſpeaketh by the Miniſtery of the
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:4399:105"/>
Word, and therefore looke for no ſtrange dreames and viſions) while the Lord ſaith, Thou art hee that longs for my ſalvation, goe thy way, I have heard thy prayers, thy pardon is granted and drawne, it ſhall be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered to thee afterward. Now when a poore ſinner findes ſome chearing of heart, he may ſay, The Lord ſpake to me, its done in heaven, mercie is comming towards mee, the pardon is now granted, and is in drawing, and ſhall be delivered to me in due time: now againe his heart leapeth within him, and hee ſaith, Bleſſe the Lord, O my ſoule, who ever heard of ſuch mercy? what? my ſinnes be pardoned? and is the pardon granted and drawne? if I never heare more of it, and if I goe downe to hell, it is enough, that God hath once ſmiled upon mee in his love, it is enough though I have the paines, of hell upon me for ever for it. <hi>Eſa</hi> 40.12. <hi>Comfort yee, comfort yee my people, ſaith your God. Speake yee comfortably to Ieruſalem, and cry unto her, that her warfare is accompliſhed, that her iniquity is pardoned.</hi> So the Lord ſaith to poore ſinners, after they have waited long enough, and God hath ſeene their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires to be ſound, the Lord, I ſay, ſaith, Tell that poore man from heaven, and from the Lord Chriſt, and under the hand of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, that his ſinnes are pardoned, and he ſhall bee received to mercy. <hi>Eſa.</hi> 66.1, 2, 3. <hi>The
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:4399:106"/>
Lord lookes to him that is poore, and of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trite ſpirit, and trembles at his word.</hi> The poore creature comes and trembles at every truth; and when hee heares of mercy, hee ſaith, Oh that is ſweet mercy indeed, but it is not mine, and he ſhakes in the conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of mercy, that he ſhould heare of it, and not receive it. <hi>The Lord lookes to him,</hi> that is, he caſts a ſweet looke upon him, and lets in ſome ſweet intimation of mercy, and ſaith to the poore creature, I have an eye to thee, and my love is unto thee in the Lord Ieſus Chriſt; and with that his heart leapes in his boſome. Of this kind I take that to be, <hi>Ier.</hi> 31.18, 19, 20. <hi>I have ſurely heard Ephraim bemoaning</hi> and lamenting <hi>himſelfe thus</hi> (there is a heart humbled, broken, and thirſting) <hi>thou haſt chaſtiſed me, and I was chaſtiſed, as a bullocke unaccuſtomed to the yoke: turne thou me, and I ſhall bee turned, thou art the Lord my God. Surely after that I was turned I repented: and after that I was inſtructed I ſmote upon my thigh: I was aſhamed, yea, even confounded, becauſe I did beare the reproach of my youth.</hi> Here you ſee <hi>Ephraim</hi> bemoa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning himſelfe, as if hee had ſaid, I am the man that have enjoyed all the meanes in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundant plenty, and yet never profited; the Lord hath corrected mee, and I was not humbled, Oh turne thou me then, O Lord, for there is no abilitie in mee. Now I ſee the
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:4399:106"/>
ſinnes that before I could not ſee, and the baſeneſſe of my evill courſes, and I am even aſhamed of the former abuſe of Gods gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and the many abominations harboured and liked. Now marke what God anſwers in that place, <hi>Verſe</hi> 20. <hi>Is Ephraim my deare ſonne? is hee a pleaſant child?</hi> as if the Lord had ſaid, Since I ſpake to him, I ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member him; all the while that the Lord let in the fierceneſſe of his wrath into his ſoule he earneſtly remembred him. I ſaw all his deſires, and I obſerved all his teares, and my bowels are towards that poore hungry and longing ſinner, that longs for my goodnes in Ieſus Chriſt, and I will ſhew mercy to him. This is the behaviour of the Lord to the ſoule, and of the ſoule to the Lord again. Thus you ſee the reaſon of the order of Gods worke; love is like the Hoſt that wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes the gueſt, and delight and joy, is like the Chamberlaine that waites upon the gueſt. This is the very guiſe of the heart.</p>
               <p>

                  </gap>, and then we have the whole frame of the worke opened. I anſwer; for the opening of the point, and the diſcovery of the truth in hand, conſider thus much.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="196" facs="tcp:4399:107"/>It is when the ſpirit of God in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe lets in ſome intimation of Gods love into the ſoule. The weight lyes upon theſe two words, <hi>Lets in;</hi> lets in (I ſay) and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyes ſome relliſh of the loue of God into the heart, when the Lord doth expreſſe any love, and favour, and goodneſſe, in that powerfull manner to the heart humbled, and longing for his favour, ſo that it doth pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile with the ſoule, and makes the ſoule to be affected with that relliſh of his favour; This is the ground of loue, the certainty of a good ſtirreth up hope, and the excellency of that good quickens up deſire, and the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of this good kindles love: there is a fulneſſe that takes up all the whole frame of the work upon all the affections of the ſoule, In <hi>Pſal.</hi> 42.8. it is ſaid,<note place="margin">Pſal, 42.8. expounded.</note> 
                  <hi>The Lord will com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand his loving kindneſſe in the day time:</hi> what is that? it is a phraſe taken from kings and princes, and great Commanders in the field, whoſe words of command ſtand for lawes; ſo the Lord ſhall ſend out his loving kindneſſe, and ſay, Goe out my everlaſting love and and kindneſſe, take a commiſſion from me, and goe to that humble, thirſty and hunger-bitten ſinner, and goe and proſper, and prevaile, and ſettle my love effectually upon him, and faſten my mercy upon him, I command my loving kindneſſe, to doe it. The Lord doth put a Commiſſion into
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:4399:107"/>
the hands of his loving kindneſſe, that it ſhall do good to the poore ſoule, yea, though he withdraw his ſoule, ſaying, what I mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy? will Ieſus Chriſt accept of me? No, no, there is no hope of mcrcy for me: In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed if I could pray thus, and heare thus, and performe duties with that enlargement, and had thoſe parts and abilities, then there were ſome comfort, but now there is no hope of mercy for me. We demand, Is this your caſe? is it thus and thus? Yes: you are thus humbled, and have thus longed for the riches of his mercy in Chriſt, haue you not? Yes. Then (ſay we) grace and mercy is yours. I cannot thinke it, ſaith he; what? ſuch a wretch as I goe to Heaven! no, no, Heaven would rather fall then ſuch a ſinner as I ſhould come to be received there. Thus he puts off mercy, and ſhuts the door againſt it; and at the laſt caſt, when carnall reaſon builds up forts againſt mercy, and ſets up ſtrong holds againſt comfort &amp; conſolation, and neither Word nor Miniſter can comfort them, then the Lord (I ſay) is faine to put a commiſſion into the hands of his loving kindneſſe: when the poore ſinner hath bin ſighing, and longing, and nothing will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent him but Chriſt, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, then the Lord gives out the commiſſion, and ſaith, Goe home to that poore ſoule, and breake open the doores upon that weary weltering heart,
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:4399:108"/>
and knocke off all thoſe bolts, and rend off that veile of ignorance, and carnall reaſon, and all baſe arguments; goe (I ſay) to that ſoule, and cheare it, and warme it, and tell him from mee, that his ſinnes are pardoned, and his ſoule ſhall be ſaved, and his ſighes, and his prayers are heard in Heaven: and I charge you doe the worke before you come againe.</p>
               <p>Here is the goodneſſe of God, to expreſſe himſelfe thus mercifully in his Word to the ſoule: if it were in mans power, no comfort ſhould ever come to the ſoule; but the Lord (bleſſed be his Name for it) he commands his loving kindneſſe to breake in upon him. As it is with an High Sheriffe, when a man will not deliver up quiet poſſeſſion to the owner, he comes with his men, and breakes open all before him, and will eſtate the man into his poſſeſſion: ſo this loving kindneſſe is the Lords High Sheriffe, and when a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of Rake-ſhames of carnall reaſon would keepe out mercy, the Lord is faine to ſend his loving kindneſſe with a commiſſion to ſeaze upon the heart.</p>
               <p>Now take notice of this, the ground of a mans love is any good which expreſſeth his preſence to him: as a good to come was the ground of hope, and the neceſſitie and excellencie of that good, makes the ſoule to long after it; ſo now, when a good is not
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:4399:108"/>
onely preſent, but expreſſeth his preſence, and leaues a kind of remembrance upon the ſoule, that ſtirres up love continually: but this muſt be done before love will come. As it is with the naturall body, if that which lyes upon a man, carries ſome weight with it, then it is eaſily felt: but if it bee marvel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous light, it may lye upon us, and wee not perceive it, as a feather, a flye, or the like; and if there comes any weight that affects the hand, either wet, or cold, or warmth, then hee feeles it; but if it be light hee per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives it not, as a mote may bee on the face, and not be felt nor ſeene: ſo love in the ſoule is like this touching of the body.</p>
               <p>Now when loving kindneſſe is not ſet on upon the ſoule, and when it leaves no expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion in the ſoule, the heart cannot be affected with it, nor returne that joy and delight that otherwiſe it would doe: ſo that there muſt be a preſent good, and a good expreſſing it ſelfe to the heart, and affecting the heart therewith, and then this love comes to God againe, Gods love affecting the heart, and ſetled upon it, it breeds a love to God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, that is the ground which S. <hi>Iohn</hi> ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth of, 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 4, 19. <hi>Wee love him becauſe he loved us firſt.</hi> As I told you in the example of the burning-glaſſe, it muſt receive the heat of the beames of the Sunne, before it can burne any thing, ſo there muſt be a beam
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:4399:109"/>
of Gods love to fall upon the ſoule, before it can love God againe; as in <hi>Hoſea</hi> 11.4. <hi>I drew them with the cords of a man, even with the bands of love.</hi> God lets in the cords of love into the ſoule, and that drawes love a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine to God. But above all, that place <hi>Cant.</hi> 2.4. (marke the manner how Gods Spirit expreſſeth himſelfe to the ſoule) <hi>He brought me into the banquetting houſe,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Cant. 2.4. opened.</note> 
                  <hi>and his banner over me was love; ſtay me with flaggons, and comfort me with apples, for I am ſicke of love.</hi> And ſo when the banner of Chriſts love is ſpread over the ſoule, the ſoule comes to be ſicke in love to Chriſt. As it is in war, when the Commander diſplayes the banner, theſe three things are ſignified by it; Firſt, that there is the preſence of the Commander: Secondly, the diſplaying of the banner com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands all to come to it: Thirdly, while it is held out, all keepe to it.</p>
               <p>Now ſee the excellencie of the Spirit of God in the Scripture. The Church was then in ſome trouble, but the Lord Chriſt brings the Spouſe into his chamber, nay, into the wine-celler, and the banner that was diſplay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed over her was love: and firſt Chriſt came as a Commander to redeeme her, and to ſave her from all troubles and afflictions. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, it commands the ſoule to come to the banner. Thirdly, when God diſplayes his love in the beautie of it, in any meaſure,
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:4399:109"/>
then all the company of poore ſinners come in unto it; and ſo they love the Lord, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Lord hath loved them.</p>
               <p>This love of God doth beget our loves in three particulars. Firſt,<note place="margin">Gods love to us, begets love in us to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him: and how?</note> there is a ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and a reliſh which Gods love lets into the ſoule, and warmes the heart with: you ſhall ſee how the fire is kindled by and by. As when a man is fainting, we give him <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qua-vitae;</hi> ſo a fainting ſinner is cold at the heart, and therefore the lets in a drop of his loving kindneſſe, and this warmes the heart, and the ſoule is even filled with the ſappi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the mercy of God: as <hi>Cant.</hi> 1.1, 2. where the Spouſe ſaith, <hi>Let him kiſſe me with the kiſſes of his mouth, for his love is better than wine.</hi> The poore ſoule, though hee drinke water, yet he drinkes better wine than any carnall man under Heaven: the kiſſes of his mouth are the comforts of his Word and Spirit. The ſoule ſaith, Oh let the Lord refreſh me with the kiſſes of his mouth, that is, of his Word and Spirit; let the Lord ſpeak comfort to the heart, and this is better than wine. (For the Lord muſt doe it, before hee can be apprehenſive of his love:) yea, let the Lord expreſſe the comfort of his precious promiſes in Ieſus Chriſt to me. And againe in the ſecond verſe, <hi>Becauſe of the ſavour of thy garments, thy name is as an ointment pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red forth; therefore the virgins love thee.</hi>
                  <pb n="202" facs="tcp:4399:110"/>
Chriſt was the oyntment, Chriſts oyntment is his graces; and the ſavour or the commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication of this, is the expreſſion of his love to the ſoule: the virgins are the ſoules truly humbled that love the Lord.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, as this warmes the heart, ſo the freeneſſe of the love of God thus let in, and thus intimated, begins even to kindle this love in the ſoule, that it ſparkles againe. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5 8. ſee how God ſets out his love to us, <hi>Seeing</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>that while wee were ſinners Chriſt died for us.</hi> This com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends the love of God, the Lord ſends to poore, miſerable, ſinfull, broken-hearted ſinners, and ſaith, Commend my mercie to ſuch a one, and tell him, that though hee hath beene an enemy to me, yet I am a friend to him; and though hee have beene rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous againſt me, yet I am a God and a Father to him; and let him not thinke, that becauſe he hath offended me, therefore hee ſhall not receive mercie from me: but here is my love, and it is worth the commendation. Chriſt died for poore ſinners, when they were enemies; therefore if God ſo loved us as to dye for us, when wee were ſinners and enemies, how ought we then to love one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother? But much more how ought wee to love the Lord? What was it that kindled that frozen, and vile, and ſtubborne, and wicked heart of wretched <hi>Saul,</hi> who had a
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:4399:110"/>
heart as hard as ice? 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24.19. when <hi>David</hi> had him upon the hippe, and might have ſlaine him, but would not, even this wrought upon the heart of <hi>Saul,</hi> and kindled a fire of affections of love towards him, and made him ſay, Come againe my ſon <hi>David, Thou art more righteous than I; for thou haſt rewarded me good, whereas I have rewarded thee evill. And thou haſt ſhewed mee this day, how that thou haſt dealt well with mee: foraſmuch as when the Lord hath delivered me into thine hand, thou killedſt me not.</hi> For who ever ſlew not his enemie, when he found him at ſuch an advantage? <hi>wherefore the Lord re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward thee good for that which thou haſt done unto mee this day. Sauls</hi> heart is all on fire with this kindneſſe. So when the poore ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner conſiders this with himſelfe, and ſaith, Is the Lord ſo mercifull to mee? who ever thus found his enemie, and ſlew him not? I that loved my ſins and continued in them, had it not beene juſt that I ſhould have peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed in them? But will the Lord not only not ſlay his enemie, but give his Sonne for mee? Oh let my ſoule for ever rejoyce in this unconceivable goodneſſe of God! Bee thy heart neuer ſo hard, if it have but the ſenſe of this, it cannot but ſtirre thee to hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Laſtly, the greatneſſe of the freeneſſe of this mercie of God, being ſetled upon the
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:4399:111"/>
heart, enflames it. This ſweetneſſe warmes the heart, this freeneſſe kindles the fire; and when the greatneſſe of the ſweetneſſe comes to be valued, this ſets the heart all upon a fire. In <hi>Eph.</hi> 3.17, 18. the Apoſtle deſires that <hi>Chriſt might dwell in their hearts, and that they might be rooted in love;</hi> but how ſhall we come to this, that we <hi>may bee able to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend with all Saints, what is the breadth, and length, and depth, and height of the love of God in Chriſt?</hi> As if the Apoſtle had ſaid, If I once come to ſee the unmeaſura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſſe of Gods mercy, this will blow up the ſoule, and enflame the heart with admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable love againe to the Lord, and make the ſoule ſay, I that have done all that I could againſt the good God, it breakes my heart to thinke it: there was no name under Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven that I did more blaſpheme, and teare in peeces more than this: I have deſpiſed no command ſo much, as the command of God, and of Chriſt, and I have grieved no ſpirit ſo much, as the good Spirit of the Lord, againſt thoſe ſweet motions that God hath let into my ſoule, and ſtruggled with me, to plucke me from my company, and to contend with me. I have taken up armes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Almightie God. If I had but gone to the top of Hell, it had beene infinite mercy, and if I had been in a dungeon all my dayes, and had another world to live, and lived it
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:4399:111"/>
all in miſerie, it had beene infinite mercie for the Lord to ſend downe Chriſt, to looke upon me a poore wretch in the dungeon, and to ſpeake to me out of the gates of hell, and to tell me of this mercie, oh it had beene an infinite mercie: but to ſend a Sonne to ſave me, it is incomparable; I could not conceive to doe ſo much evill againſt him, as he hath done good to me: oh the breadth of that mercy beyond all limits, oh the length of that mercie beyond all time, oh the depth of that mercie below a mans miſerie, oh the height of that mercy above the height of mine underſtanding! If mine hands were all of love, that I could worke nothing but love, and if mine eyes were able to ſee no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but love, and my mind thinke of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but love, and if I had a thouſand bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, it were all too little to love that God, that hath unmeaſurably loved mee a poore ſinfull hel-hound: <hi>Pſal.</hi> 18.1. <hi>I will love thee</hi> dearely, <hi>O Lord my ſtrength.</hi> Oh have I gotten the Lord Ieſus Chriſt to bee my comfort, my buckler, my ſhield? If I have any good, he gives it, and if any good bee continued, it is he that doth it, and if I have any comfort in it, it is hee that bleſſeth it to me; therefore I will love thee dearely, Oh Lord my ſtrength. Thus the point is cleare, and ſtands upon his right bottome.</p>
               <p>Now I come to the Application of it, that
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:4399:112"/>
wee may reape ſome good and comfort to our owne ſoules. And the uſe of the point is fourefold: for Inſtruction, for Conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,<note place="margin">Nature breeds no love to Chriſt.</note> for Reprehenſion, for Exhortation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vſe</hi> 1. Firſt, for Inſtruction, which I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire a little to commend to you, becauſe it is ſeaſonable. Is it ſo that the Spirit of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther kindles this love in the heart truly hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled and enlightned, &amp;c? then conclude this undeniably, That there is no power in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, or in a naturall heart, I ſay, there is no ſufficiencie in the power of nature, to bee carried to any love towards Chriſt: we have not this before God gives it, nay, wee can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not move our ſelves in love to God, before the Lord let in the ſparkes of love into our ſoules. True it is, we find it by wofull expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, it is in our power to love the world, and to delight in baſe luſts, and being but naturall men, it cannot be but that we ſhould love our ſelves, and the things of this world: there is enough of theſe wilde fires, and of this baſe worldly luſt in every natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall ſoule to expreſſe it ſelfe; but to love the Lord Ieſus Chriſt, and to have a heart in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged towards him, it is a worke of grace that growes not in our hearts; I ſay there is not one ſparke of holy love, and of this ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fire of love in our hearts at any time, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can we buy or borrow it at the hands of any under heaven, further than the Spirit
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:4399:112"/>
of the Lord is pleaſed to kindle it, and to inflame this grace of love to the Lord Ieſus, and further than the Lord by the power of his merits is pleaſed to feed this in our ſoules. It is an unconceiveable miſery, that any man ſhould bee ſo farre deluded, as to thinke that he can do it by his owne ſtrength and power: Saint <hi>Paul</hi> expreſſeth it in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering the vileneſſe of himſelfe by nature, and the freeneſſe of Gods grace: 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.13, 14. I was <hi>before a blaſphemer, and a perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutor, but I obtained mercy:</hi> I wronged Ieſus Chriſt, and was malicious againſt him, and oppoſed againſt his children: <hi>Paul</hi> could doe this of himſelfe; ſo thou canſt be mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious againſt the Lord, and againſt the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of his grace and truth, this a naturall man can doe; but for him to love the Lord Ieſus Chriſt, and to beleeve in him, how came Saint <hi>Paul</hi> by that? Why the <hi>grace of God was exceeding abundant</hi> towards mee, <hi>with faith and love, which is in Ieſus Chriſt.</hi> As if he had ſaid, it was abundant grace that over-powred my unfaithfull heart, and made me beleeve; and it was abundant grace that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-powred my injurious heart, and made me love Chriſt. But how was this? it was by the grace of Chriſt, from Chriſt this faith was wrought, and in Chriſt this love was kindled. As if hee had ſaid, I thought to caſt off the Lord and his grace, I was a
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:4399:113"/>
perſecuter and a villaine indeed; but that I ſhould beleeve the Lord, and love him, this was from Chriſt, it was in grace, and not in <hi>Paul.</hi> The ball muſt firſt fall to the ground, before it can rebound backe againe; ſo the Lord Ieſus muſt firſt dart in his love into the ſoule, before the ſoule can rebound in love and joy to him againe; wee muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive from grace, before wee can rebound backe any love to God: as 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.7. <hi>God hath not given us the ſpirit of bondage, but of power, of love, and of a ſound minde.</hi> See what the Lord ſpake in ſome caſe of the Iewes, <hi>Iohn</hi> 5.40, 42. (ſpeaking home to their hearts) hee ſaith, <hi>I know you, that yee have not the love of God in you.</hi> Verſe 40. he ſaith, <hi>Yee will not come to mee:</hi> and in the 42. verſe <hi>I know you, that yee have not the love of God in you.</hi> As if hee had ſaid, I know it, you know it not your ſelves, and though you thinke you have this love to mee, yet you are deceived, you know not what you are, nor what you know, but I know: and it is as true of every corrupt heart under heaven, the love of God can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not bee in the heart of any naturall man whatſoever.</p>
               <p>The reaſon why I preſſe this point ſo much, is this; it is for theſe two ends, you ſhall ſee a double benefit by it.<note place="margin">Carnall men conceive no difficulty, to love Chriſt.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt, this confutes and overthrowes the
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:4399:113"/>
conceits of a company of carnal Goſpellers that ſay, they faſt not, nor pray not, nor profeſſe not ſo much as ſuch and ſuch, but for the truth of their love to Chriſt they defie all the world, they find no difficulty in the matter, and they make no doubt ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; and therefore if any Chriſtian man, or any faithfull Miniſter of God, ſhall begin to challenge them with the want of love to Chriſt and grace, they will anſwer, What? not loue the Lord Ieſus? it is pitty that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer that man ſhould live; they have loved him, and will loue him for ever, and all the world ſhall not perſwade them to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary. Oh poore deluded creatures! it is an undoubted argument that thou never hadſt the loue of God in thee, becauſe thou thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keſt it ſuch an eaſie matter to love him. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny men make nothing of it, they make it but an holy-day taske, and ſay, Who cannot love Chriſt? I ſay, neither thou nor I can doe it by any power or vertue in our ſelues; nay I ſay thou art as able to ſave thy owne ſoule, and to redeeme thy ſelfe without Chriſt; as thou art able to love Chriſt, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe he by the power of his ſpiritenable thee to doe it. Nay, you that make nothing of it, to loue Chriſt, marke what I ſay: If a man might have happineſſe in hand, and heaven laid downe upon the nayle, if he could love the Lord Ieſus of himſelfe, I ſay, if he had
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:4399:114"/>
no more but nature, he would never goe to heaven, nor never bee happy: Nay, it will coſt more than ſo, it will coſt time and paines, and many teares and prayers; you muſt have the Father come downe from heaven to teach you, and you muſt goe to another ſchoole than ever you were at yet, before you can learne it: and unleſſe the Father make you able to loue Chriſt, you can never doe it. It is true, if it were nothing but pratling and profeſſing, and yet to ſtand in open oppoſition to the power of grace and the ſpirit, this cannot bee: for to welcome a Saviour, to receive Chriſt anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to the worth of him, a man cannot doe it by the meere power of nature, it is the worke of the Lord, as the Apoſtle Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> ſaith, 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1.5. <hi>God is light, and in him is no darkneſſe:</hi> and <hi>Epheſ,</hi> 5.8. <hi>You were darkneſſe:</hi> God is nothing but holines, and you are nothing but darkneſſe. Now you know darkneſſe can oppoſe light, and wickedneſſe can oppoſe holineſſe, but ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver give way to it nor receive it: This is thy nature and condition, thou haſt an ignorant darke heart of thine owne, but the Lord is altogether holines and light, and thou canſt not receive it, nor wilt thou receiue him. As 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2.10. they would not receive the truth of God in the loue of it: the truth of God makes love to thy carnall heart, and
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:4399:114"/>
would plucke thee from thy baſe luſts and corruptions, and would woo and winne thy ſoule, that it might take place in thy heart, the world will not receive it. Ieſus Chriſt came into the world to ſave ſinners, but the world would not receive him, ſo farre were they from ſeeking to a Saviour; that they would not receiue him though he came to offer himſelfe to them; thou haſt a heart that hateſt Ieſus Chriſt, and cannot loue him; and thou haſt a heart that can oppoſe him and his grace, but canſt not take content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in that grace and rich mercy of his: if thou haſt not grace and mercy, thou haſt but what thou wouldſt haue, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is juſt thou ſhouldeſt never haue it.</p>
               <p>The ſecond cauſe,<note place="margin">Saints Iove not as they might and ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly not on the promiſe.</note> why I preſſe this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, is this, To ſhew the diſorderly proceedings of many poore Saints, that la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour extremely to worke their owne ſoules, and to bring their hearts to love Chriſt, that they even fall out with themſelues, and curſe their baſe hearts, that can loue the world, and cannot loue Ieſus Chriſt: they labour much, and would bring their hearts to loue him, but they cannot doe it, becauſe they goe to worke the contrary way, they would bring loue to the promiſe, and not receive love from the promiſe, as if a man ſhould bring water to the ſea, or light
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:4399:115"/>
to the ſunne. It is as if he would have a ſun of his owne: and yet there is but one ſunne of righteouſneſſe, that can kindle this loue of Ieſus Chriſt, to carry it ſelfe worthy of him. Therefore be wiſe herein, and thinke not to bring love to the promiſe, but come to the promiſe for it, and goe to the ſea for water, and looke up to the ſunne of Gods loue, and be under the beames of Gods mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and looke not down into that dead frozen heart, of thine own: for if thou wouldſt never ſo faine, thou canſt not receive one ſparkle of this love from thy owne abilities. See his love therein, and bee thereby drawne to love him againe, and ſee the fulneſſe of thoſe pleaſures at his right hand which endure for ever: <hi>Ioh.</hi> 16.14. the Lord Chriſt ſaith, He ſhall ſend the Spirit the Comforter, and he <hi>ſhall take of mine,</hi> that is, take of Chriſts. All ſpirituall graces are Chriſts, therefore goe thou thy way, and tell the Lord thus much ſaying, In truth Lord I have not a heart to love thee, it is thine owne worke, and thou haſt ſayd that thy ſpirit ſhall take of thine and give it to thy ſervants that thy ſervants may alſo give thee of thine owne againe: that love; and that delight is thine to give, that wee may giue thee of thine owne, as <hi>David</hi> ſpoke of the building of the Temple.

A man by nature cannot have this, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore haſt thou this by grace. Goe thy way, as he that hath found a treaſury, and make much of it, and ſay, and know, thou haſt ſomething more than all carnall wretches can have, and thou haſt more than all the cunning cloſe-hearted hypocrites under heaven can have, let them pretend, and fain, and flatter what they will. Me thinks this ſhould wonderfully refreſh the hope of you poore ones: for though many times other things goe not well with you, yet this is enough to cheare up your hearts for ever. You know a childe will loue his father, though hee can doe little for him: he is a child, and therefore though he can doe lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle for his father, yet if he love his father, hee is contented: ſo they that haue little meanes, and ſmall ſufficiencies towards a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſervants of God, and it may be their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandings are not ſo deepe as others be,
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:4399:116"/>
and their tongues runne not ſo glib as ſuch and ſuch, and they cannot talke ſo freely of the things of grace and ſalvation; and thou haſt meaner parts, and canſt not enlarge thy ſelf in holy duties, and holy ſervices (though this is commendable where it is) and thou canſt not diſpute for a Saviour, and perform ſuch duties as others can doe, yet thou canſt loue Ieſus Chriſt, and reioyce in him. Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinkes there is many a poore ſoule would ſay, I bleſſe the name of the Lord, that's all that I haue; the Lord knowes that all the friends I have, and parts, and meanes, and abilities in the world, they are but as dung and droſſe in compariſon of Chriſt: Oh it were the comfort of my ſoule, if I might be euer with him. Goe thy way, and the God of heaven goe with thee, this is a worke of God that will never leaue thee, and it is a badge and a proper livery that the Lord Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus gives onely to his Saints: never a meere profeſſor under heauen ever wore it, nay there was never any hipocrite under heauen to whom God did intend it, but onely thoſe whom he hath effectually called, and whom hee will ſave: therefore though thou wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt all, thou haſt all to comfort thee in the want of all, and thou maiſt ſay, I can ſay little for Chriſt, my tongue falters, and my memory is weake, yet the Lord knowes I loue the Lord Ieſus, 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 4.7. it is the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:4399:116"/>
that the Apoſtle gives, ſaying, <hi>Love one another, for love commeth of God, and every one that loveth is borne of God.</hi>

               <p>Indeed he preſſeth it in regard of the love to the brethren: but the arguments ſerve for our purpoſe; for if the loue of the brethren come from God, then the loue of God is a more ſpeciall worke of God. Therefore can you plead thus with your hearts, and ſay The time was, Lord, that this wretched ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full carnall heart of mine, could find no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh in the promiſes of grace, and I could not bring this baſe heart to love the Lord Ieſus Chriſt, and the promiſe was weari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome to me; but now I thanke God I can doe that which before I could not doe, I thanke God that the promiſe of life, and the light of Gods countenance is more to me now than all the contentments of the world: ſurely I loue the Lord Ieſus Chriſt. And is not this of God? Yes, I warrant theee: it is not of thy ſelfe, thou haſt beene taught from heaven; it was not the ſchoole of the fleſh and the world, that taught thee this lecture, it is from heaven, and the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of the Father hath over-ſhadowed thee in his promiſe, and hath kindled this ſparkle of loue in thee, and thou haſt that which is ſound and true: therefore bee comforted and reioyce in it, thou canſt ſay, more than any man under heaven can ſay, that hath

                  <note place="margin">Notes of true love to Chriſt</note> Now for the anſwer to this queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: let every man put his love vpon the triall, and wee will ſay no more then that which we have ground for from the doctrine deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered. Therefore examine thy loue and thy joy thus; Whether doſt thou welcome Chriſt and grace according to the worth of them? Now marke this, if I prove I love God, then there will be joy there too, for they both grow upon one root, onely this joy hath a little more of the ſweetneſſe of Gods love in it. Now whether we welcome Chriſt according to the worth of it, it will appeare by theſe five particulars:</p>
               <p>Firſt, obſerve the roote and riſe from whence thy love came;<note place="margin">1. <hi>Triall.</hi>
                  </note> conſider this and weigh it ſadly, for it is of great difficulty, yet it is never failing, and it is the narroweſt ſearch that I know of: therefore looke well to it; if it come from the right mint, it is cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant. You know it is the priviledge of Kings and Princes,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> that all the coine that comes from his Mint and is coined with his ſtamp, is warrantable: but if there bee any other Mint, the King will not allow of it, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:4399:118"/>
puniſh him that did it, luſt ſo it is with this love, it is the priviledge of the Lord Ieſus Chriſt, the Sonne of Gods love, to mint and to coine love that may bee currant love indeed, that hee may take for good payment. Therefore doth thy love come from the Spirit of the Father? then it is onely fit to cloſe with a Saviour, with the Father, and the Spirit, and ſo conſequently the Father allowes it. Great men muſt bee entertained anſwerable to their perſons:<note place="margin">Another.</note> for ſuch a man to have poore and leane diet, it is not meet for him; the greateſt delicates that can be, doe beſeeme ſuch men of place. So this leane, and earthly, and naturall love, that growes onely out of thy owne parts and abilities, or whatſoever it is, it is but leane love, and poore proviſion, and ſuites not with God the Father, nor Ieſus Chriſt. Baſe love and baſe things for baſe men, and meane love for meane things, and naturall love for naturall things: but would you en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaine the Father from heaven, and a ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall Saviour? then you muſt let your love be ſpirituall, to welcome a bleſſed Saviour. This beſuits him,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> and otherwiſe he will not be entertained. As it is with flowers, the flowers that are of ſpeciall planting, (as <hi>Iere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my</hi> ſpeaks of the <hi>Iewes</hi>) and the flowers that are inoculated by the hand of the cunning Gardiner, as the Provice Roſe, or the like,
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:4399:118"/>
there is much care and paines about them; but your ordinary hedge row Roſes, there is no care taken for them. Iuſt ſo it is with the worke of Gods grace, and all other common graces in the world, there is a provice love and joy, that is a love that comes from the planting, and a joy that comes from the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oculating of the ſpirit. This provice love and joy is wrought by the Spirit of God, and this makes a ſweet ſavour in the noſtrils of Almighty God, and of the Lord Ieſus Chriſt; and the Lord Chriſt will ſay, Oh that love pleaſeth me. They cannot welcome the Lord better than with this love; but the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther love and joy pleaſeth him not. Canſt thou ſay, I love the Lord, becauſe hee hath loved mee? then thy love is of a right mettall; and know it for ever, that that God which cannot but love himſelfe, hee cannot but like that love which came from himſelfe, who is the God of all love, and which comes from his owne divine nature. Is thy ſoule affected and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged in love to the Lord, becauſe thou haſt felt and received the relliſh and ſweetneſſe of his grace? Doſt thou love and joy in God upon this ground, namely upon a grounded affection of Gods loue to thee, ſetled and ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to thy ſelfe? ſo that thou canſt ſay, The Lord, hath let in the glimpſe of his favour, and the Lord hath ſaid it in his truth, hee
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:4399:119"/>
lookes to him that trembles at his word: the Miniſter ſaid it, and the Spirit ſaith it, that my mercy is regiſtred in heaven, and my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires are received and granted. Oh how ſhall I love the Lord? My ſinnes are many which I have bewailed, and my ſighes and ſobs I have put up to heaven, and at laſt the Lord hath given mee a gracious anſwer. O how may I love the Lord my ſtrength dearly! Lord thou haſt looked downe from heaven in love and mercy upon me, and therefore my ſoule ſhall ever looke up to heaven to thee in love. If it be thus with thee, thy love is ſound, and will never faile thee: but if any mans love comes from himſelfe, and therefore loves God, that love will onely bring all to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, and there is the end of it. A man hath a love to his parts and abilities, and prayer, and preaching and reading and conference, and underſtanding, and policy; hee loveth theſe, and therefore he would fain be behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den to Ieſus Chriſt, to helpe him to honour and to glorifie theſe parts of his. This love was from his parts, and brought to his parts, and in the meane time the Lord Ieſus lay in the duſt, and his glory was not regarded: whereas the love that is wrought by God, it alwayes doth draw the love of the ſoule a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine to God, and ſo love from him draws love to him. This is the excellencie of this love, and this is love of the right kind. But
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:4399:119"/>
if the love of parts and profits draw me to honour and glorifie parts and profits, then I love my profits and not Chriſt. Thinke of this often, this is certaine, this will bee the maineſt difference betweene all the love of carnall hypocrites, and of the Saints of God. I would expreſſe my ſelfe to you thus: As it is with meat which a man takes downe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly and digeſts it, this breeds good bloud; but that meate which a man eates and ſpits out againe, and tarries not long with him, this breeds no bloud at all: So it is in the heart of a poore humbled ſinner truely wrought upon to receive Chriſt in the worth of him, and with the hypocrite. A heart truely wrought upon by Gods Spirit, it takes downe the promiſe and feeds upon it, and it breeds good bloud and complexion. True love is like this good bloud, and true joy is like this complexion. Marke this, the promiſe of God ſettled upon the heart nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſheth and feedeth the heart, and it breeds good bloud: but the fooliſh hypocrite, that hath a kind of flattering ſweetnes, this tickles the heart with vaine conceits, but they never goe downe. And hence it is, that that love which comes from hence, it is but a fading love, and there is no good bloud, nor no good complexion comes from it, but rather corruptions and overture.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2. <hi>Triall.</hi>
                  </note> as the root of this love muſt be
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:4399:120"/>
from the kindling of the Spirit; ſo if thou en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaine thy Saviour as it beſeemes him,<note place="margin">True love of Chriſt, enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains him as a King.</note> thou muſt entertaine him as a King, and that is thus, give up all to him, and entertaine none with him upon termes of honour, but ſuch as retaine to him, or be attendants unto him: this is the manner of receiving great Princes. Love all in a Chriſt, and for a Chriſt, but expreſſe thy love and thy joy to a Chriſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all: he is as the King, and all the reſt are but as retainers, and all his ſervants are as ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants to him. He that loves any thing equall with a Chriſt, it is certaine he did never love a Chriſt: but he that ſets up any thing cheeke by joll with Chriſt, he deſpiſeth him, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver receives him. It is all one as if a man did put a ſlave into the ſame chamber with the King, which is all one as to drive him away. So if thou doſt ſet up any thing with Chriſt, thou doſt drive him away with ſuch baſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour. As in <hi>Iames</hi> 4.4. <hi>O yee adulterers and adultereſſes, know yee not that the friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of the world is enmity with God? whoſoever therefore will be a friend of the world is an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my of God.</hi> A man cannot retaine fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip with Chriſt Ieſus and with the world too upon point of honour;<note place="margin">Simile.</note> As the woman that loves her husband, ſhe loveth other men as friends and neighbours, and will give them very courteous entertainment, and welcome them kindly: but if they come to claime the

love of a wife, ſhe abhorres and deteſts them. So a loving heart that loves Ieſus Chriſt as the Bridegroome, he loves Chriſt onely, and all for Chriſt, and the reſt as friends, &amp;c. The ſoule wil love honors, or profits, or cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit, or parts and priviledges, that they may be friends to ſpeake for a man, and to give a man occaſion to ſpeake with a Saviour: as the wife loves the husband firſtly, and all the reſt ſhe regards onely as they may further the match this way; ſo the Lord Chriſt and his grace is chiefe to the ſoule, but the world, and eaſe, and credit, theſe are meerely as friends to leade him to a Saviour, and make him ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with a Saviour. The ſoule loves the word, and prayer, and all Gods ordinances, to ſpeake a good word to a Saviour for him, but all the reſt are deſpiſed by him; and if any of them come to claime the love of a ſoule from a Chriſt, it hates them deadly: as <hi>Luke</hi> 14.26. <hi>If any man come to mee, and hate not father and mother in compariſon of me, he is not worthy of mee:</hi> that is if father and mother ſtand betweene thee and Chriſt, and would have thy ſoule married to them again, the ſoule hates them. This is a plaine diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betweene a ſound heart and a falſe heart; in the receiving of Chriſt the ſound heart receives him as a favorite receives a Prince, he gives up all to him,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> and lets him have the command of all: (but now an Inne-keeper
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:4399:121"/>
entertains him that comes next to him; he will take any mans money, and will give welcome to any man, if it bee the beſt man that comes he cares not, he loves gaine in and aboue all.) So a good heart reſignes up all to a Chriſt, and whatſoever is pleaſing to a Chriſt he will doe it, and whatſoever comes from a Chriſt is welcome: but if any man be an enemy againſt his Majeſtie, and would doe any violence againſt him, he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not endure it. But the hypocrite receives Chriſt as the Inne-keeper doth his gueſt, if the world come it ſhall be ſerved, and if ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour come it is welcome, if he may have gain from them they are all welcome, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all is welcome becauſe hee may haue gaine by all; and ſo he loves himſelfe in all, and not Chriſt.</p>

See this, <hi>Cant.</hi> 3.4.5. the Spouſe ſought long for her beloved, and
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:4399:121"/>
at laſt brought him home; and when ſhe had wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comed him, ſhe gives charge to all the houſe <hi>not to ſtirre nor awaken her love till he pleaſe.</hi> When a Prince comes into the houſe of a great man, what charge is there given to make no noiſe in the night, leſt ſuch or ſuch a man bee awakened before his time? (And were it not a baſeneſſe in us, if wee ſhould have our hearts more in love with any thing than the ſervice of Chriſt?) The ſoul alſo when it hath received the Spirit of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, gives a peremptory charge to keepe watch and ward, and gives a charge to hope, and deſire, and love, and joy, and the minde, and all, not to grieve nor moleſt the good ſpirit of the Lord; let there bee no motion but entertaine it, no advice but receive it, and doe nothing that may worke the leaſt kinde of diſlike. In <hi>Gen.</hi> 19.5, 6, 7, 8. when <hi>Lot</hi> had received the 2 Angels into his houſe, the curſed Sodomites came about the houſe to abuſe them; but ſee how <hi>Lot</hi> pleadeth with thoſe baſe wicked people; <hi>I pray you, my brethren, doe not ſo wickedly: Behold now I have two daughters which have not known man, them will I bring forth unto you, and doe unto them as ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth good unto you, onely to theſe men doe nothing, for therefore are they come under the ſhadow of my roofe.</hi> This is kinde and honourable entertainement indeed; he would rather ſuffer himſelfe than they: ſo a loving heart will doe with Chriſt; he ſaith, Let my ſoule bee wounded, and my honour lye in the duſt, that Gods name may be honoured; let perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, and ſhame, &amp; diſgrace, and any thing come
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:4399:122"/>

So a ſoule truly humbled is not content unleſs God may have his will, and therefore it comes to the faithfull Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of God, and ſaith, How may I pleaſe God better? and how may I come to entertaine the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of his ſpirit better? ſhew me what duties muſt be done, and what ſinnes muſt be avoided. You know Chriſts will, and what will pleaſe him; I beſeech you adviſe me, that I may heare, and pray and walke, and approve my heart ſo to him, that nothing may diſpleaſe him. This I take to bee the maine difference betweene a good heart, and a falſe hypocriticall one.<note place="margin">Simile.</note> For looke what difference there is between a man that takes a ſervant into his fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and a Noble-man that receives a Prince, ſo much difference there is between a good heart, &amp; a falſe hypocriticall heart: Now a man entertaines a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>va<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t into his houſe, to the end he may ſerve &amp; pleaſe himſelfe, and that the ſervant may give content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to him, becauſe hee is wiſe, and able to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch his occaſions, and likewiſe diligent to looke throughly to all: and therefore it is that the ſervant is entertained, not for the ſervants ſake, but that hee
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:4399:122"/>
may content his maſter. But he that doth receive a Noble-man into his houſe, he labours to give him all the content that may be, he layes by all, and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends onely upon him: and though hee be a man of great ſtate; and hath many to attend on him, yet all the ſervants are charged to ſee that nothing bee wanting to his gueſt; nay, he will rather diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent himſelf than him: becauſe he comes out of an honorable reſpect to viſite him, therefore he wil re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive him as beſeemes his ſtate and perſon. Juſt ſo it is with a faithfull ſoule, that receives Chriſt in the worth of him, and one that receives him for gaine onely: the one receives Chriſt as a ſervant into his family; and ſo all the while that the Goſpel, and the profeſſion of it, and the Lord Jeſus, may promote his eaſe, and honour, and credit, then welcome Goſpel; but if his profits, and honour, and credit, and the Goſpel cannot agree together, he turnes all out of doores, and of a profeſſor hee proves a loather of Jeſus Chriſt, becauſe he received him to content himſelfe withall: But hee that receives Chriſt in the worth of him, will not pleaſe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, and his luſts, and his pride, and vaine-glory, but though they that are his neareſt friends call him, and ſay, they muſt have his company and his attendance, yet hee replies, No, hee cannot, the Lord Jeſus Chriſt muſt be attended; and when the old haunts of heart, and old lewd courſes that have had inward league with the poore ſinner, come and crave, and plead for acceptance, hee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gards them not; nay, an humbled ſoule will rather
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:4399:123"/>
diſpleaſe all the great men in the world, yea, the neereſt man that he depends upon, and all that glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and pompe, than Jeſus Chriſt.</p>

                  <note place="margin">4 <hi>Triall.</hi> It rejoyceth moſt to ſee Chriſt honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</note>4 Fourthly, he that loves any thing in the worth of it, it is his good and happineſſe to ſee the good and happineſſe of that thing which he loves: this is an undoubted argument of ſound affection, that that which he loves ſhould have all good, though hee miſſe it; If any good befall that thing which hee loves, hee thinkes himſelfe happy, and had rather ſee that honoured than himſelf: this is true love, &amp; a marvellous ſweet paſſage of a loving heart, yea, it is the very picture of true love. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 23.17. When <hi>Saul</hi> had made a cunning ſearch for <hi>David,</hi> and he was fled, <hi>Jonathan</hi> comes to him, and chears him, ſaying, I know that my father ſhall not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile againſt thee, but that thou ſhalt be King over Iſrael, and I ſhall be next thee. <hi>Jonathan</hi> was <hi>Sauls</hi> Sonne, and he might have ſaid, I am my fathers heire, and why may not I bee his ſucceſſor in the kingdome? but he loved <hi>David,</hi> and rejoiced in his good, and therefore he ſaid, Thou ſhalt be King over Iſrael, and I ſhall bee next unto thee: As if hee ſhould ſay, I am more glad that the Crowne ſhall be ſet upon thy head, than if it were ſet upon mine owne; for my ſoule is thereby comforted and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhed. So it is with a good heart that loves Jeſus Chriſt, and his grace, and his Goſpel in truth; the happineſſe, glory and the honour of the Lord Jeſus is the greateſt good that can befall him; wherefore he ſaith, If the Lord may be honoured, though I am
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:4399:123"/>
diſgraced I care not; it is enough to me if may ſtand to behold and ſee it, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3.26.29. When the Lord Chriſt began to ſet forth the frame and glory of the Goſpel, and to baptize, the Diſciples of <hi>John</hi> came to their Maſter, and ſaid, <hi>Rabbi, he that was with thee beyond Jordan, to whom thou bareſt wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, behold the ſame baptizeth, and all men come to him:</hi> they began to be troubled becauſe the Lord Jeſus baptized, and the praiſe went from them: as if they had ſaid, There is one come that carrieth the hearts of all men after him. Now mark what <hi>John</hi> anſwered, <hi>He that hath the Bride is the Bride-groome;</hi> as if he ſhould ſay, The Lord Chriſt is the Bride-groome, and I am onely the friend of the Bride-groome: all my care was to prepare hearts for him; and hath he now gotten thoſe hearts? and hath he proſperitie? then have I enough: if I heare that the caſe goes well with him, I have enough; let the Lord have the praiſe that is due to him, and let me have whatſoever is due to me. 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 19.30. when <hi>Mephiboſheth</hi> had been wrongfully ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed to <hi>David,</hi> and <hi>David</hi> had taken away the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance from him, and was returned in ſafety, ſo that he ſaw the Kings face againe, <hi>David</hi> began to comfort him, ſaying, <hi>Thou and Siba divide the land;</hi> but marke how he replies, <hi>Yea</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>let him take all, for as much as my Lord the King is come a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine in peace.</hi> It matters not for the inheritance; and for my ſelfe, and my life I paſſe not, fith the King is returned in peace: it is enough that I enjoy thy preſence, which is better to me than goods, life,
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:4399:124"/>
and liberty. So it is with a kinde-loving heart, when hee is not able to indure to ſee Chriſts honour and glory lye in the duſt, but if his praiſe be advanced, then he is glad; this is a good and loving heart in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed which ſaith, Lord I have enough that Chriſt is mine, and that his honour and glory is magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: Let the world take all, if I may have Chriſt, and ſee him praiſed and magnified. Labour to bring thy ſoule to this pitch: a miniſter in his place, and the maſter in his place, and every Chriſtian in his place; let it be all our care, not onely to honour God our ſelves, but let it be our comfort if God may be better honoured by others than by our ſelves. This is our baſeneſſe of ſpirit; we can bee content to lift up Chriſt upon our ſhoulders, that we may lift up our ſelves by it: this too much pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailes amongſt all men. But be content to lye in the duſt, that the Lord may be praiſed, though thou be diſgraced; And though every mans heart goe op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite againſt thee, yet let this content thee, if the Lord Jeſus may thrive and proſper; yea if any of Gods people thrive and proſper more than thou, let that be thy onely joy.</p>

This flowes directly from the nature of love, eſpecially of this love to Chriſt, who is the greateſt good: love is of a linking and glewing nature, &amp; will carry the ſoule with ſome kind of ſtrength &amp; earneſtneſs
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:4399:124"/>
to injoy full poſſeſſion and fellowſhip of the thing that is loved; it cannot have enough of it, and it is not ſatisfied with it upon any occaſion. As it is (in reaſon) with a childe,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> happely when the father en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaines him at the table, hee gives him a little ſweet-meat, as ſome Conſerve, or the like, which is ſo ſweet that he can taſt nothing but that, and his minde is ſtill upon it, that he may receive more of it: the father commends this and that, and praiſeth a third, and extols a fourth diſh, but yet the childe cryes, More of this, becauſe hee felt the ſweeteneſſe of it: So it is with a ſoule that truly loves Chriſt; when it hath taſted how good the Lord is, and hath had a good looke from heaven, it covets uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, not ſo much with any thing as with that; riches, honours, profits, ſeeme as irkſome as may be, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of that, &amp; the ſoul deſires nothing ſo much as this, and craves more of Chriſt, more of that mercy, and holineſſe, and grace, and love that is in him: let the wicked talke what they will of the world, if he have that he hath enough. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73.25. when <hi>David</hi> had been doating upon the world, and the vanities of it, ſee what he ſayth; <hi>Whom have I in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven but thee, and whom on earth in compariſon of thee?</hi> and then ſee what followes, hee bids a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dieu to the world, and ſayth in the laſt verſe, <hi>It is good for me to draw neere unto God:</hi> as if he had ſaid, Let the ambitious belly-gods have their pleaſure, &amp; drinke, and ſwill, and goe downe to hell: But oh let mee have that mercy, and that good which God hath provided for, and will beſtow
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:4399:125"/>
upon thoſe that love him. You ſhall obſerve it, <hi>Joh.</hi> 20.15, 16, 17. <hi>Mary</hi> was a marvellous loving woman, and therefore when Chriſt ſaid to her, <hi>Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, why weepeſt thou? whom ſeekeſt thou? ſhe ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing him to be the Gardiner, ſaith unto him, Sir, if thou haſt borne him hence, tell me where thou haſt laid him, &amp; I will take him away:</hi> She would be content to have the dead body of her Saviour rather than none at all. But when the Lord Jeſus had revealed himſelfe to her in the 16 verſe, ſhee ſaid, <hi>Rabboni;</hi> and when ſhe ſaw it was he, ſhe flies upon him, and with marvellous violence embraceth him (for ſo the text is to be conceived) though hee forbad her to touch him, becauſe hee was not yet aſcended: ſaying, Doe I once poſſeſſe thee againe? I will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver part with thee any more; thus ſhe held him by the feet, till he checked her, becauſe ſhee depended too much upon his outward preſence. <hi>Touch mee not</hi> (ſaith the Text) <hi>for I am not yet aſcended:</hi> thou ſhalt enjoy my preſence before I part with thee; but as yet be not ſo earneſt: ſo it is expreſſed, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.1. This is a lively expreſſion of that love and joy which many poore ſoules are poſſeſſed withall, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they have waited long for mercie, and God is pleaſed to refreſh them therewith: many times they begin to loſe their ſleepe, and meat, and begin to be lightened by it, becauſe they are ever holding of it, till they almoſt overthrow themſelves with it.<note place="margin">Simile.</note> As it is with parties that have lived long toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in one houſe, whoſe affections are linked toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the way of marriage, they will ever deſire
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:4399:125"/>
to be talking together, and ever to be drawing on to the marriage: So it is with the ſoule that loves the Lord Jeſus, &amp; hath this holy affection kindled, and his ſpirit enlarged therein; when the Lord hath let in ſome glimpſe of his love, he thinks the houre ſweet when hee prayeth to the Lord Chriſt, and hath a great deale of ſweet conference with his Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour; he thinks that Lords day marvellous ſweet, wherein God revealeth, by the power of his holy ordinance, any of that rich grace and mercy of his. It is admirable to ſee how the heart will be deligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to reckon the time, and place, and meanes, when and where the Lord did reveale it: and the ſoule ſaith, Oh this is good, oh that I might ever be thus cheared and refreſhed; it cannot have enough of this if it might have what it would, but, as <hi>David Pſ.</hi> 84.2, 3. ſaith, <hi>My ſoul longeth, yea even fainteth for the Courts of the Lord: my heart and my fleſh cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth out for the living God. Yea the ſparrow hath found an houſe, and the ſwallow a neſt for her ſelfe, where ſhe may lay her young, even thine Altars, O Lord of Hoſts, my King and my God;</hi> as if hee had ſaid, Goe you bleſſed birds, you may build your neſts by the Altar of my God, and come into his houſe; Lord, am not I as good as birds? His heart was marvellouſly inflamed with the want of that which he loved. Nay, in <hi>Luke</hi> 2.29. good old <hi>Simeon</hi> had his heart ſo enlarged to Chriſt, that hee could have been content to depart this life, ſo hee might have his fill of Chriſt. The ſpouſe that is contracted, thinkes every day a yeare till ſhe enjoy
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:4399:126"/>
her beloved. Oh, ſayth ſhe, would that day were come that I might injoy him, and take full ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to my ſoule in him: ſo it is with a loving ſoul, that hath been truly humbled and enlightned, is now contracted to Jeſus Chriſt, how it longs af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter him! Oh when will that day be (ſaith it) that I ſhall ever bee with him who is beſt of all? it takes hold of every word it heares, every promiſe that reveales any thing of Chriſt; but oh, when will that day bee that I ſhall ever bee with Chriſt? This is the higheſt pitch of Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> ſpeech, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.23. <hi>For I am in a ſtraight betweene two, having a deſire to depart and to bee with Chriſt, which is beſt of all:</hi> as if hee had ſaid, that I may ever be with that mercy, and grace, and ſpirit that is in Chriſt, and be filled with his fulneſſe for ever and ever.</p>
               <p>This is the frame of the ſoule that is in love with Chriſt, yea this is the ſtrong and glewing nature of love, that it will make a man deſire to be with the thing loved, though hee muſt undergoe never ſo great miſery to obtaine it: as <hi>Gen.</hi> 37.35. when <hi>Jacobs</hi> ſonnes brought the party-coloured coat to their father, he ſayd, <hi>It is my ſonnes coat, an evill beast hath devoured him: and he rent his cloaths, and put ſack-cloth upon his loines, and mourned for his ſonne many dayes. And all his ſonns, and all his daughters roſe up to comfort him, but he refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to be comforted: and he ſaid, For I will goe downe into the grave unto my ſonne mourning:</hi> he had rather be in the grave, than not to be with his ſon <hi>Joſeph.</hi>
                  <pb n="231" facs="tcp:4399:126"/>
If a womans husband be in priſon, it is her wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full griefe that it is ſo, but moſt of all that ſhe may not be with him there; Thus alſo is it with the ſoule that entirely loves Chriſt, it is content to goe to the priſon with him, and ſaith, Let mee bee with Chriſt though hee bee perſecuted. It is his griefe that Chriſt is perſecuted, but it is a greater griefe that hee may not bee with him in perſecution. As the Spouſe, <hi>Cantic.</hi> 2.16. <hi>My beloved is mine, and I am his;</hi> and as the wife ſaith, Husband, let the world doe and ſay what they will, thou art mine, and I am thine: So the ſoule ſaith, mercy is mine, and Chriſt is mine, if I may have that, I have e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, but without it I cannot be quieted.</p>
               <p>Secondly, there is an holy impatience, and reſtleſſeneſſe of ſpirit, when it cannot come to cloſe with Chriſt. Oh it is good to expreſſe the earneſt deſire of the ſoule to Chriſt, though he ſeeme to hide his face away, and to forbid the banes of aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king. Thus it appeares what it is to love the Lord Jeſus.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Uſe</hi> 3. Now the pill is ſugered,<note place="margin">Reproofe of them that love not Chriſt in truth.</note> it will go downe the better, therefore now let us come to the uſe of reproofe; and this is as a ſwift witneſſe to accuſe, &amp; as a Judge to condemne many in the world: this is ſufficient to ſhake the heart, and to make the hearts of moſt that live in the boſome of the Church, to ſinke at the very ſight of their wofull condition, in whoſe heart this bleſſed grace of God was never yet received; I meane, that never loved the Lord Jeſus; woe to their ſoules: yea, this is the greateſt
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:4399:127"/>
part of their woe, that though they doe not love Chriſt, yet they doe not thinke ſo; nay, they will not be perſwaded to it. This is the cunning that the Divell uſeth to deceive poore ſoules withall, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe theſe affections are ſecret and inward, neither diſcover themſelves evidently to the heart, fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than practiſe goes: therefore they think others know them not, and here they reſt: they lean upon a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pany of ſottiſh deluſions which will faile them; thus they and their hopes periſh for ever. Wicked men cannot but confeſſe their owne vileneſſe, that their communications are vaine, and their fall ſcandalous; but this is that which ſalves all, they ſay, their lives are ſo indeed, but they love the Lord Jeſus with all their hearts. When theſe wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches have ſworne by their Saviour, and have torne his ſacred body in ſunder with their oathes and blaſphemies, yet they love Chriſt with their ſouls: poore deluded ſinfull men!</p>
               <p>Now for the better convincing of theſe men, firſt let me make it good, that moſt men have not this love of Chriſt, and ſo lay the inditement Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, let me plead the inditement, and ſhew who they are that have it not.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Moſt in the Church love not Chriſt.</note>Firſt, moſt that are in the world, yea that live in the boſome of the Church, have not their hearts carried in love to God, but in a hatred and deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate oppoſition to the Lord Jeſus: as in <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.3, 4. <hi>In him was life, and the life was the light of the world.</hi> The Lord Jeſus was the life and light of the promiſe, and that promiſe of life was a way to
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:4399:127"/>
lead men on to eternall happineſſe; this light ſhineth to the dark world, but they comprehend it not: as it is in <hi>verſ.</hi> 11. <hi>Hee came unto his owne, and his owne received him not. His owne,</hi> by reaſon of their priviledges, and the badge of the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances; <hi>his owne,</hi> becauſe they by profeſſion took his name upon them, as the Churches of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles are Gods owne by the outward, not the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward covenant of Sanctification, or in the aime of Election. We take up the profeſſion of his Goſpel, and yet we will not take up the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, that he may make us Chriſtians. <hi>His owne received him not;</hi> thoſe that were baptized, and had received the Sacrament. The Lord Jeſus comes and knockes at each mans doore, but few entertaine him: Nay, I would not outſpeake the truth, (for they are the words of ſobriety, and it grieveth me to ſpeake it) The moſt men upon earth hate Chriſt more than ſinne: I had almoſt ſaid it, and yet I had almoſt thought it unfit to be ſpoken, though they are the words of our Saviour: Wicked men hate the Lord Jeſus more than either ſinne, or the Divel himſelfe. Good Lord be mercifull to us! what a miſery is this, that ever any man ſhould be created by him, and receive mercy from him, and yet love the Divel and ſinne more than him.</p>
               <p>But ſome will ſay, as <hi>Hazael</hi> did to the Prophet, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 8.12. Doe you thinke we are ſuch dogges, that having received ſuch mercy from the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, we ſhould doe ſo? Yes for ſo ſaith <hi>Eliſha</hi> to him, <hi>I know the evill that thou wilt doe to the children of

Iſrael: their ſtrong holds wilt thou ſet on fire, and their young men wilt thou ſlay with the ſword, and wilt daſh their children, and rip up their women with child.</hi> So, I ſay, and the Spirit knowes it is ſo in the hearts of moſt men this day. You know it not, you thinke it not; but your hearts are more vile than you can imagine. Wee know the greateſt evill of all is ſinne, for the Divell himſelfe is not to be loathed but for ſinne, and for it onely: <hi>This is the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation</hi> (ſaith our Saviour in <hi>John</hi> 3.19.) <hi>that light is come into the world, and men loved darkneſſe rather than light, becauſe their deeds were evill.</hi> That men loved darkneſſe more than light, and more than Chriſt, nay, more than mercy and grace that was tendered, the caſe is cleare; it was ſo, and is ſo, &amp; will be ſo: I ſay it is moſt certaine, that they love their luſts and corruptions more then Chriſt, and the temptations and deluſions of Satan, more than the good motions of the Spirit. Now we have laid the indictment, therefore in the ſecond place let us plead it.</p>

Surely, no, there are many Leaders of the Divels camp, aſwell Miniſters as others. But if you aske me what enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainement their luſts have; I ſay they have all the welcome that can be: occaſions come not, corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions within their hearts ſtirre not, and the Divels temptations allure not ſo ſoone, but theſe miſerable ſinfull wretches give all the kinde welcome that can be unto them: nay, they invite their villanies, they provide for them, yea, and ſeeke for all occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions that they may ſinne: the Adulterer loves the twilight, and the coveteous man his money, their mindes are ever puffing, and their affections labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring

But if you aske mee how they entertaine Chriſt,<note place="margin">Enmity againſt Chriſt ſhewed three wayes.</note> let me ſhew it by two things; you ſhall ſee them up in armes, and at deadly hate with him: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> For firſt, they oppoſe the word of God: the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry of the word is the miniſtery of the truth; it would open the eyes, and come home to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, and take away their ſinnes, but they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temne it; and marke upon this what an uproare there is, they take up armes, ſtriving to put out the light that would ſhew them their ſinnes, beating backe the truth, and labouring that it may not rule their lives: They are ſuch as our Saviour ſpeaks of, <hi>Luk.</hi> 19.27. <hi>Bring hither thoſe mine enemies, that would not have me rule over them, and ſlay them before my face.</hi> They oppoſe themſelves againſt that truth that would plucke the cup from the Drunkards mouth, and the whore from the Adulterers armes: their hearts ſwell for anger, and they ſcorne to bee under the power thereof. Nay, they not onely with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw themſelves from yeelding obedience to the holineſſe of the word, but they will not ſo much as acknowledge the truth of it, which the Divels themſelves did, <hi>Act.</hi> 16.16, 17. when <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las</hi> were preaching the word of truth, the Divels ſayd, <hi>Theſe men are the ſervants of the moſt high God, which ſhew unto us the way of ſalvation.</hi> The Divels could doe all this, yet theſe men will neither be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:4399:129"/>
nor convinced, that the duties that God commands, are, To be holy as he is holy, and pure as hee is pure, and not only to make conſcience of outward abominations, but of inward corruptions: But they flye out, and ſay, I will never beleeve it, and, I will not be of that opinion. The Divels could ſay, Theſe are the ſervants of the living God, and, this is the way of life, and, theſe are the ſervices commanded. Lord be mercifull to us, what hearts have theſe men, that goe not ſo farre as the Divels themſelves! Secondly, ſee how they behave them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves when they come into the preſence of Jeſus Chriſt; if the Lord comes amongſt them by the preſence of his children, their hearts are deſperately carried againſt all the appearance of grace in them; now they that hate poore Chriſtians for their grace which they have received from Chriſt, hate Chriſt and holineſſe more. That which I have to ſay to theſe men, is this; that they would not ſuffer themſelves to be ſo deluded, but would goe home, &amp; reaſon with themſelves in this manner, and ſay; the truth is, I have heretofore deceived my ſelfe, and might have beene damned, had not the Lord beene mercifull to me: I pretended to hate them for their diſſembling, but it was for their grace and holineſſe. If any man hates the picture of a man, ſurely he hates the man himſelfe much more; ſo if they hate the ſhew of holineſſe, much more doe they hate the power and vertue of it. Doe I love the beames of the Sunne? then I love the Sunne much more; and if I hate a poore Chriſtian, becauſe
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:4399:130"/>
God hath brought him home, then I hate Jeſus Chriſt, and his grace much more: if I hate the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorne for the lights ſake, then I hate the light much more. A poore Saint hath a little ruſh candle of holineſſe and purity, of grace and meekeneſſe, and he carries this before a company of baſe drunkards, and filthy adulterers, that the countrey cries ſhame of; now if theſe hate the man that beares the light, will they not much more the light it ſelfe? Againe, of this ranke of open oppoſers, are all ſimple and ignorant creatures, that know nothing of grace nor holineſſe; who though they can ſay nothing ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther againſt the truth, or the people of God, yet they will commend what the wicked commends, &amp; joyn ſide with them: they not only approve what theſe doe, but in their hearts and hands are the very ſame: The Scribes and Phariſees ſent to take Chriſt, and the people cried, <hi>Crucifie him, Crucifie him:</hi> they did it not, yet they gave their voices; &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith, <hi>Ye are they that have crucified the Lord of life.</hi> By this you know what will become of your husbands, wives, and friends. <hi>Mat.</hi> 23.29. your forefathers ſlew the Prophets, and the Scribes and Phariſees builded their Sepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers, that is, approved of what they did And as it is in a Campe, ſome are Captaines, and Leaders, and Commanders, and ſome attend upon the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage; now though all bee not Captaines and Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, yet all are of the ſame Campe: ſo there are ſome Leaders and Commanders, and groſſe perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuters of Chriſt, which the people of God finde

hard meaſure from; but the poore carnall Goſpel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, they follow after, they are but the taile of the Divels army, yet they are of it; they are all young Divels, onely their teeth are not ſo ſharpe, nor their clawes ſo long as others; they have not lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned that skill, to make a prey of a poore Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian.</p>
               <p n="2">2.<note place="margin">Glozing neu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters deſcribed and ſhamed.</note> The ſecond rank are the glozing Neuters of the world; theſe alſo love their ſinnes more than Chriſt, nay they love not him at all in truth; theſe are they that halt between two opinions, your faire fooles, that would harme no man; ſo no man would harme them: the higheſt pitch that theſe come to, is this, that they may get reſpect and credit among the beſt, and they ſay, He that meddles leaſt is hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pieſt: theſe are pretty good civill neighbours, and will ſometimes doe a man a good turne, provided that they may not hurt themſelves: they will be of all ſtraines; if a wretched man come, they will bee like him, and now and then ſtrew forth faith and troth: they will not reprove others, becauſe they ſhall not cenſure them. And, as they will gloze with them, ſo ſometimes they will invite a Miniſter to their houſe, and now and then get him to preach, and ſometimes ſtraine hard for a little good confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence; but above all, thoſe Miniſters pleaſe them beſt, that will not meddle with any perſonal ſinnes. If the Miniſter will bee onely generall, they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend him highly, and ſay, Oh he is a very wiſe diſcreet man, and knowes how to carry himſelfe; yes, and he knowes not how to meddle with them,
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:4399:131"/>
you muſt marke that: and if he will preach Doctri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall things, and take five or ſixe Doctrines in a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, oh then he is a judicious man, and takes the very creame of the Scriptures; but if hee come to diſcover their baſeneſſe, and to meddle with their corruptions, Oh then they fall to reading that they may not heare, and wiſh that the man would keepe him to his text. Theſe men doe as it were intrench upon the articles of agreement between the Lord Jeſus Chriſt and the Goſpel; they covenant that they will not trouble nor perſecute the Goſpel, and they would not have the Goſpell to trouble them. And if the Miniſter come to touch upon any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular ſinnes, and labours to bring them a ſtep higher, Oh then they are weary, and think a mean between both is beſt; they account zeale in a good courſe like the hot fit of a feaver, very dangerous, and therefore they like beſt of a cold luke-warme temper in their profeſſion, for thoſe ſpirits are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable wholſome. They eat out the power of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion in this maner, and they love not the Lord Chriſt: Theſe men do with profeſſion as the Neu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trall cities doe in other countries, they will not joyne with the one ſide nor with the other, but doe any thing that they may not be controlled: yet if the ſtronger ſide begin to take up Armes againſt them, and labour to bring them in ſubjection, they then will ſide for their advantage: This is the true picture of formall Neutraliſts in a Chriſtian courſe, they wil faſten themſelves to the world, that the world may not diſtaſt them; and to the better
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:4399:131"/>
ſide, that they may not diſtruſt them. He will pray in his family, onely that hee may couzen in his ſhop. Hee that is a formall Neutraliſt, will have two or three good ſervants to entertaine ſuch as are good; but he will have a knave and a drunkard alſo, to cloſe with ſuch as are bad; and thus hee playes with both hands: But if the powerfull preaching of the Word come to cloſe with him, and ſay hee muſt leave all his baſe ends and aimes, and lay downe himſelfe and his baſe courſes, Oh then hee turnes againſt the Goſpel, and hee is not able to ſtoope to it, nor to be framed by it. Theſe men deale with Chriſt as men that enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain a neighbour liberally, to this end, that he will look to his owne grounds onely, and not intrench upon his; for to have him a Land-lord or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander over him, and to bee in dependance upon him, this he cannot beare: But the Saints of God doe the ſecond, they entertaine Chriſt as a Land-lord, but the other onely as a neighbour. Let theſe men know, that all thoſe that are not with Chriſt, are againſt him: though a man ſtand ſtill and doe nothing, and love not warre, becauſe he would bee in peace, let him (I ſay) know that all the wrong that is done by others, if he be not a helper againſt it, the Lord will require it at his hands, as if he had done it himſelf, as in that place, <hi>Curſe ye Meroſh,</hi>

therefore the Lord will deale with thee as he did with that luke-warme Church in the Revelation, the Lord will ſpue thee out of his mouth: luke-warmneſſe is loathſome to the ſtomacke; therefore appeare in your colours what you are, that you may be knowne either a Saint or a Divell: lukewarme water goes againſt the ſtomacke, and the Lord ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hors ſuch lukewarme tame fooles.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Hypocrites, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies of Chriſt.</note>3. The third ranke of thoſe that love not Chriſt, are the fawning hypocrites, that will fawne upon the Lord Jeſus, that make admirable faire wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and profeſſe marvellous affectionate love unto him; and will ſpeake for a good cauſe and hazzard himſelfe in it, and when all is done, he is an inward hater of Chriſt. Of this ſort I take <hi>Saul</hi> to bee, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15.13. the Lord gave a commandement to goe and kil all the <hi>Amalekites;</hi> who, when he ſaw <hi>Samuel</hi> comming toward him, ſaith, <hi>Bleſſed bee thou of the Lord</hi> (here marke the tricke of an hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite) <hi>I have performed the commandement of the Lord,</hi> and therefore bleſſed be God that I ſee thee, that I may give up my account unto thee: But, ſaith he, <hi>What meaneth then this bleating of the ſheepe in mine eares, and the lowing of the oxen which I heare?</hi> I need not ſpeake, for the bleatings of the ſheepe ſhew that <hi>Saul</hi> is an hypocrite. Theſe men may be diſcovered by theſe two paſſages: They doe not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to give contentment to Jeſus Chriſt, but to themſelves; and withall, they lift up their own glory with Chriſt.<note place="margin">Foure ſorts of hypocrites.</note> Of this ranke there are foure ſorts; The wrangling hypocrite, The whining hypocrite,
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:4399:132"/>
The vaine-glorious hypocrite, The preſumptuous hypocrite.</p>
               <p>The firſt ſort is the wrangling hypocrite: I know many men that will profeſſe they are at your command, to ſerve you, and to doe what they ſhall be commanded, and, they ſhall thinke themſelves happy to be imployed by you, and yet in concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on they intend no ſuch matter. They deſire to live no longer &amp; to do nothing but that which may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote the honour of the Lord Jeſus, and if they did not think to honour him by this or that, they would not doe it: but if it come to this, that a man muſt leave his profits, or livings, or honours for Chriſt, he will not ſay expreſſely he will not do it, and that hee will not part with his honours and profits for Chriſt, but yet he will ſtand to quarrell, and ſay, It is not fit to doe it, and, there is no command for it. It is admirable to ſee and to conceive the vileneſs and baſeneſſe that is in the ſpirits of theſe men; for when the duty is revealed and enjoyned, they will ſearch far and neer to make it no duty, they will rake the Divels skull, and invent ſome new ſhifts to prove that it is not needfull to be done, that ſo they may avoid the doing of it: as it is amongſt ſome that follow the faſhions of the times, though they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to doe things comely, and to keep cloſe to the Word, yet if a new faſhion come up, though never ſo abſurd, they will forget their promiſe and plead for it, not queſtioning what is lawfull, but what moſt pleaſes their humour. But obſerve this in thy owne ſoule, do not thinke to quarrell with thy ſelfe
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:4399:133"/>
about duties which the Lord requires at thy hands: But art thou in good earneſt content that the Word ſhould be true as God would have it, and to have that accounted naught which God ſaith is naught? It is certaine many will ſay it for ſhame, but they have an inward league between them and ſome ſin, they will not have that lawfull that they may not doe, and they will not have that to be ſinne which God ſaith is ſinne, that they may commit it with quiet, eaſe, and liberty, ſtriving more to content their owne hearts, and the faſhion, then Chriſt. They muſt content their liberty, they will not be impriſoned, and therefore will give full content to a ſpirit that deſires freedome. Theſe never had this fire of love to Chriſt kindled in their hearts.</p>
               <p>Now before I come to the next, give me leave to unmaske this hypocrite, and to dogge him to his owne doore: and for this end, Firſt, I will ſhew what this pretence of love to Chriſt is: Secondly, I will ſhew the prankes that hee hath to cover his hypocriſie withall; and when both theſe are opened, it will appeare that he onely intends to wrangle, and that he hath not this true love of Jeſus Chriſt. For firſt, he wil joyne ſide with Chriſt in the generall, &amp; in the common; nay when it co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>es to the particular caſe, wherin his heart withdrawes, yet therein alſo he wil vow openly, that he doth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but what his conſcience tels him is fit to be done, and that which his judgement is fully ſatisfied in. Alas poore conſcience! he hath couzened thee before, or elſe curbed and charmed thee by ſaying, I
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:4399:133"/>
am reſolved that it is not ſo, &amp; therefore conſcience you muſt be of my ſide; yet conſcience replies, You ſhould not do this or that; let the Lord have the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and take you the ſhame, that all may be warned for ever. Thus it was with the old Prophet, 1 <hi>Ki.</hi> 13.18. when he came to couzen the young Prophet, he ſaid, <hi>I am a Prophet alſo as thou art, &amp; an Angel ſpake unto me by the word of the Lord, ſaying, bring him back with thee into thine houſe.</hi> And thus it is with this wretched hypocrite in his pretence of love unto Chriſt, it is cleare in his conſcience, he dares not do any thing againſt the Lord Jeſus, and in his judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and in his conſcience he thinkes ſo, and ſo hee hath peace at home: but let him goe with his peace. Again, he will talke marvellouſly of Gods honour, and of the promoting of the Goſpel, &amp; the publike affaires, and they are of great force to make him do any thing: and this is ever in his mouth, that the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall good may goe on; and, if good may be done to the Church, thats all he cares for. The bottome of the buſineſſe is this, there is a good living that he muſt keepe, and a private good that he aimes at; hee pretends a generall good, but he aimes at his owne good: Wretch that he is, he labours onely to give contentment to his honours, and eaſe, and credit, but hee gives no contentment to the Lord Jeſus. In 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15.21. <hi>Saul</hi> comes to meete <hi>Samuel,</hi> and ſayes, <hi>I have performed the commandement of the Lord,</hi> Haſt thou? No, God had thee kill the Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lekites, and thou haſt not done it: Oh, ſaith he, <hi>The people ſpared the best of the ſheepe, and of the oxen, to
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:4399:134"/>
ſacrifice unto the Lord thy God:</hi> he would pretend to do God a courteſie; He doth not pretend his own good and benefit, but the publike good, the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and ſervice of God; and therefore he ſaith, They have ſaved them for to ſacrifice to the Lord; and in the meane time hee wrongs God, and neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lects his ſervice. As ſome great Courtier will doe with a plaine Countrey-man, hee uſeth him very lovingly, pretends great kindneſſes, till at laſt he ſo deludes him, that he thinkes he doth him a great favour not to doe the thing which hee askes at his hands: ſo the hypocrite thinkes with himſelf, what great honour God may receive, and what good the people of God may have from him; but that is not the thing hee lookes after, hee would make God and Chriſt believe he doth them a cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſie, not to doe the duty they require of him: But the Lord Jeſus is wiſer than to be thus couzened by a wretch, and therefore <hi>Samuel</hi> ſaith <hi>verſ.</hi> 22. <hi>Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience is better than ſacrifice, and to hearken then the fat of rams:</hi> ſo when a wretch ſaith, What great good may Gods people have by this? and what glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry may come to God? &amp;c. the Lord Jeſus will ſay to all ſuch, No no, have I ſo much delight in ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice? cannot I promote my glory without your lie? take your lies and your ſins, and go down to hel to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Diſcoveries of not loving Chriſt.</note>Secondly, obſerve the prankes whereby he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covers himſelfe to have no love to the Lord Jeſus; and they are three.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, the maine guiſe of the ſpirit is this, In the
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:4399:134"/>
multiplicities of opinions he will be ſure to joyne with that ſide that may make for his owne ends, though he know not the men that hold it: he ſaith, many men many mindes, therefore I thinke as ſuch and ſuch thinke; his meaning is this, he is reſolved to doe that which he thinkes may be moſt beneficiall to him, &amp; therefore it is enough that any man doth as hee would have him, becauſe he would doe ſo, though he had no ground for it.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, he will be loath to be ſtudiouſly care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in the diligent ſearch after thoſe things which he makes doubt of; and though he will not ſay ſo, yet marke what I ſay, many in the anguiſh of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience have confeſt ſo much. As he is loath to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire himſelfe, to know thoſe truths; ſo hee is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to come into the ſociety of ſuch, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue with thoſe that he knowes to be of a contrary opinion to himſelfe, that will force him to a ſad and ſerious conſideration of his wayes: and hee thinkes thus with himſelfe, If I be there they will be every man upon my crowne, for they are ever in hand with ſuch and ſuch things; ſo that while he is there he ſtands upon thornes, and ſaith, What if they ſhould talk of this or that? Thus it was with <hi>Ahab,</hi> the wretched ſottiſh king was not willing to heare <hi>Michaiah</hi> ſpeake, for hee knew what hee would ſay; for when <hi>Jehoſaphat</hi> ſaid, <hi>Is there not here a Prophet of the Lord beſides, that we might enquire of him?</hi> Yes, ſaith he, there is one <hi>Michaiah, but I hate him, for he never prophecies good to me,</hi> 1 <hi>King.</hi> 22.7, 8. Thus the young man, <hi>Matth.</hi> 19. when hee
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:4399:135"/>
heard that which was contrary to him, went away ſorrowfull; whereas a good heart would have come ſorrowfull, and ſaid, I bleſſe the Lord for this mercy that I may live to heare of the hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſie of my heart: Lord I deſire a better oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to heare more of this matter, my heart is worſe than I imagined. This hypocrite cannot endure to heare of that eare: and if he be in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, he is weary of the ſpeech, and ſaith, There is better communication, and more uſefull than this; but the reaſon is, he would not be troubled in his way.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, the guiſe of this wrangling hypocrite lyes here, that if he be forced to a ſerious conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of his way and opinion, then he will enter upon the worke, but it is very tediouſly; he will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend a faire hearing, and conſult on both ſides, but when he comes home, he makes a ſecret conſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy againſt the Lord Jeſus: Is it not ſo conſcience? &amp; he ſaith, I am thus reſolved, that that is true which I would have: either it is ſo, or elſe I will make it ſo, therefore let us agree upon it, conſcience. In <hi>Act.</hi> 23.15. ſee what thoſe wicked people ſaid, <hi>Yee with the Councell ſignifie unto the chiefe Captain that he bring him down unto you to morrow, as though yee would enquire ſome thing more perfectly concerning him, &amp; we, or ever he come neere, are ready to kil him:</hi> Here they pretended a faire equall hearing, and yet they intended another matter. Such a courſe this hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite takes up againſt the truth of Chriſt; he will talke and inquire of this &amp; the other, as if he would
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:4399:135"/>
know more of Gods will; and read this and that book, &amp; enquire of this Miniſter and that Chriſtian, but he is reſolved never to be perſwaded nor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of the truth of it: Thus they break the neck of the truth, and ſhall break their own necks in hell too. In <hi>Acts</hi> 4.16. there is a great worke done; that cannot be denied, but let us take heede that it goe no further. It is with theſe hypocrites, as it was with the Scribes and Phariſees, who, though the glory of the truth ſhone upon them, yet would they ſtop it, and, that it might get no hold upon them, knocke off the fingers of it. It is admirable to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve this hypocrites guiſe, if there bee any man that will but ſay any thing that may tend to his way, he applauds that man, and delights much in him, and, though hee know no reaſon for it in his conſcience, yet he contents and ſatisfies himſelfe: but if there be never ſo good arguments to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, never ſo many reaſons that cannot be gaine-ſayd, yet he is not ſatisfied, neither can he be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded by all theſe arguments; The reaſon is, he is reſolved to doe whatſoever hee hath purpoſed for his honour and ſafety, and therefore it muſt bee lawfull that hee may doe that which hee hath pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed: Let there bee but ſome frothy Miniſter, or ſome fooliſh man or woman, that will com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend faſhionableneſſe, the faſhion-monger will hugge him in his armes, and ſay, Hee ſpake mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellous wiſely to the point, and very judiciouſly, though he had not one argument; &amp; whatſoever is ſpoken to the contrary, he will not believe it: but
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:4399:136"/>
the Scripture hath no ſuch thing; for where are thoſe words of yellow ſtarch, bands, and the like? Well, it is ſufficient that he is faſhionable to the world: the iſſue is this, hee is contented to give himſelfe honour, and eaſe, and liberty, but hee will not content the Lord Jeſus Chriſt; and therefore I ſay he never had this love of God, nor this ſaving grace in his heart. <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.8. <hi>But unto them that are contentious, and doe not obey the truth, but obey un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſneſſe;</hi> not thoſe that are contentious with their neighbours, but againſt Gods truth: What of them? why, to them ſhall be <hi>indignation and wrath.</hi> Such were they 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.4. <hi>Hee is proud, knowing nothing.</hi> When a man ſhould come and joyne ſide with the word of truth, hee is puft up in his vaine minde, and hath no ſound worke of grace in his heart:<note place="margin">He that wran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles againſt truth, never loved Chriſt:</note> I doe not ſay that hee which is ignorant in any truth of Chriſt, but hee that thus wrangles with any truth of Chriſt, that man can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not have any ſound evidence of Gods love in this bleſſed worke of grace: and this I prove thus.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">2. arguments.</note>Firſt, hee that will have this evidence of Gods love, muſt entertaine the truth aright, that is, in the love of it, not for his own private ends &amp; aimes, not becauſe it is profitable or honourable, but becauſe it is true; and he that entertaines one truth in the love of it, will entertaine every truth ſo far as it is revea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led: but this hypocrite doth not entertain the truth in the love of it, and therefore hee cannot have any ſound evidence of Gods love.</p>
               <p>Secondly, never any man had, as yet, this worke
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:4399:136"/>
of true grace, that is not yet come from under the power of ſinne and Satan: for no man is come from under the power of ſinne, or the dominion of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, that will joyne ſide with ſinne and Satan a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the truth; but this man doth joyne ſide with ſinne and Satan againſt the truth of God, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore was never come from under the power of ſin, and ſo conſequently never had this worke of grace. I compare this wrangling wretch to the Merchant, that will trade with other Princes, but not ſubmit to them as King: ſo this man will trade with the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, but not ſubject himſelfe unto it; and therfore he is but a hang by and a retainer, and one that makes a booty of the Goſpel. Thus much of the wrangling hypocrite.</p>
               <p>The ſecond ſort is the whining hypocrite, who will continue daily to abuſe the Goſpel, and to grieve the Lord Chriſt, and he thinkes to make up his wrongs, by laying open his ſorrow that he hath done ſo, and thus he thinkes to be friends with him againe. As it is with ſome ſervant, whom the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter will neither let goe, nor yet uſe as a ſervant: ſo it is with theſe whining hypocrites; they have great need of the power of the Goſpel, and yet they are not willing to bee under the power of it; however they keepe it in, and fawningly flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it, and if they come and ſay, they are ſorry for this and that, then all ſhall be well, and they entreat the Lord not to take it ill at their hands, they will mend it, &amp;c. ſo that in truth they love not the power of the Goſpel, but onely to make gaine of it
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:4399:137"/>
to themſelves.<note place="margin">Simile.</note> As it is with ſome whining debtor, that partly out of covetouſneſſe would not, and partly through indigencie cannot pay, hee will come and complaine of his hard peny-worth, and deſire ſome reſpite, not that he may give content to the Creditor, but to himſelfe: So it is with this whining hypocrite, hee will ever bee complaining, but never amending. I ſpeake not againſt ſorrow and complaining, as though they ſhould be altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther quit of the body of death, and of diſtempers, and of their curſed luſts and corruptions; (for if a man love Jeſus Chriſt as much as ever any mortall man did, yet he ſhall never be quit of this body of death ſo long as hee is here) but I ſpeake againſt thoſe that are ſtill complaining and vexing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in the outward appearance, who have teares at command, becauſe of ſome violent paſſion, or for ſome diſcredit to the Goſpel, or ſome diſgrace to themſelves, and yet ſtand juſt at the ſame ſtay. Oh varlets, that confeſſe their ſin to Chriſt, and yet for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake it not, that they may love him! that thus they may fawne upon Chriſt, making their ſorrowes a plea for their ſin, and think to cry and whine it out, and yet returne to their old courſes againe! Thus it was with <hi>Ahab,</hi> 1 <hi>King.</hi> 21.15. who killed <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>both</hi> for the vineyard, and in the 27 verſe, hearing <hi>Eliah</hi> denounce ſuch heavie threatnings againſt him, &amp; knowing himſelfe to be guilty of that ſin, he faſted, and prayed, and rent his clothes, yea prayed in print, as the proverbe is, but yet hee returnes to his old byas again, for in the next chapter he hated
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:4399:137"/>
                  <hi>Michaiah</hi> ſtill. This is but the bathing of a mans ſins, not the drowning of them: he thinks to pleaſe Chriſt, and to keepe Chriſt with him, becauſe hee cannot be without him; and though he ſinne againſt him, yet he thinkes to make all whole with com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining. This is too ordinary in the world. The rebellious hearted ſinner, that is croſſe and peeviſh, and froward, he will be a profeſſor in a high ſtrain, and pretend great love to the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and complaine of his froward heart, but yet he falls into paſſion upon every occaſion, and hee to, by his complaints, thinkes to make all whole againe. This is baſe falſe hypocriticall love, and not the love of the Father that will enable a man to give content in thoſe things that he may eaſily doe. I can hire theſe men from their paſſion for money, and ſcare them from it by the Magiſtrate; And ſhall a reward hire thee, or a Magiſtrate ſcare thee, and ſhall the Lord Jeſus have no power over thee to cauſe thee to doe it? Goe thy way, thy heart is naught: if thy love were ſound, it would worke more than all this comes to; that is not love at all, that is not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to doe ſo much as this for Jeſus Chriſt: the like I may ſay of the untoward doggedneſſe of ſome husbands and maſters; it is their life to fret and talke like mad-men; and thus the cunning chapman will cheat you to day, and whine to morrow, and hee thinkes this pleaſeth the Lord Jeſus very well. Shee is not accounted a loving wife, but an adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſſe, that when ſhee hath played the harlot, will come and whine to her husband, and yet goe to it
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:4399:138"/>
againe; no, if ſhee had a true heart to her husband, and ſought for peace, ſhe would not have returned to her vile courſes againe: So it is with the ſoule, it is adulterous and baſe love, and not the love of the Spouſe of Chriſt, to confeſſe and bewaile ſinne, and yet to commit it. That ſorrow which looſens the heart from ſinne, and makes it come neerer to God, and ſo to be rid of corruption; that ſorrow, I ſay, gives content to Chriſt; but that ſorrow which indeed doth incourage a man, and rather give way to the commiſſion of ſinne, than looſen the heart from it, gives no content to the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, but to thy ſelfe; and ſtands not with the alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance of him, but of ſin: but yet if thou canſt ſay ſo, and ſorrow ſo, as to be looſened from thy ſinne, then thou contenteſt the Lord Jeſus; but if thou thinkeſt thou haſt a warrant, or a privie ſeale for thy ſinful practices, becauſe thou haſt ſorrowed, this argues little love to Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> But ſome will ſay, May not a man make his moane, and expreſſe his griefe for ſinne?</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Expreſſion of ſorrow for ſin, limited.</note>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> I anſwer, Yes, it is fitting and neceſſary; yet conſider theſe two rules.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> 1. Firſt, make it not an ordinary table-talke, for that ſmells too groſſely of falſe hypocriſie: as if a man did ſay, Now I hope every man will take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice how I mourne for ſin; but rather if thy heart be full, and ſurcharged with griefe, inquire what is the danger of ſuch and ſuch corruptions, and the cauſe of them, and how thou mayſt get power a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them, but keepe thy ſorrow in ſecret.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="259" facs="tcp:4399:138"/>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 2. Or elſe in the ſecond place, thou ſhouldſt make thy ſorrow knowne to ſome godly Miniſter, or faithfull Chriſtian, out of the burden of thy ſin, and not for faſhion ſake: thus doe, that thy heart may be looſened from thy ſinne, and thou ſee thy need of a Saviour.</p>
               <p>A third ſort is a new upſtart hypocrite, that is newly come up; many of them are in other parts, and ſome neere unto our owne ſelves: they are ſuch as are full of carnall confidence, and are proud of their beleeving; but faith ſhuts out boaſting. They are as full of hypocriſie as an egge is full of meat, or a toad full of poyſon. Such an hypocrite I will diſcover to you thus. Hee is a man that hath long profeſſed the truth, and hath ſeene his ſinne, and been awakened to his owne ſenſe, and hath had a kinde of attendance to the Goſpel, and a kinde of brainiſh acquaintance with the promiſe in Jeſus Chriſt, ſo that now he is fully perſwaded that Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt is his, and he is Chriſts. And yet after all this, when he is come thus farre, he lookes no more after himſelfe, but lookes all to the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, inſomuch that the Lord Jeſus becomes a drudge to him. Now the guiſe of this man is this, he caſts away all ſorrow, and reaſons thus: For me to ſee my vileneſſe, and to be ſenſible of the body of death, and to bleed inwardly, and mourne daily for my wickedneſſe, I thinke is needleſſe: theſe are paſt with him, for he ſayth, I have mourned before this day, and now I have gotten Jeſus Chriſt: thus he thinks he needs not be afflicted with his ſins, nor
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:4399:139"/>
mourne for his many failings; but the Lord Jeſus, who he thinkes is at his command, muſt doe all, and thus he ſurfets on his ſinnes ſtill. This is the root of the doctrine of the Familiſts, that curſed, helliſh, &amp; unconceiveable baſeneſſe that is in them. I have heard of many of them, that after long pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion and much zeale and exactneſſe in a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an courſe, have fallen unto this ſtraine, and come to juſt nothing. A poore ſinfull deluded Sot thou art, thou poore creature; doſt thou entertaine the Lord Chriſt as a Commander, when thou wilt not have him ſo much as to diſpoſe of thee, but as thy drudge, that thou mayſt take what mercy thou wilt, and leave what thou wilt? They will have Chriſt to pardon their ſinne, but not to make them mourne for it, as if (in truth) they meant that hee ſhould ſtand at their beck. They reſt upon their faith, and will not have themſelves and their faith to reſt upon Chriſt: for this is their conceit, they apprehend they doe beleeve, and there they reſt, and ſo in concluſion they never goe to Chriſt to have their hearts humbled and brought under; as if a man ſhould goe and graſpe with his hand, and take no hold of the rocke, he neither findes ſtrength to himſelfe, nor any hold to his hand: ſo they reſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their faith, and neither they nor their faith upon their Saviour. Thou ſinfull deluded hypocrite, the Lord Jeſus will make thee come under, and ſtoope, and force thee and thy carnall confidence to lye in the duſt, and begge for mercie. Can any man in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon judge this to be love, which in deed is nothing
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:4399:139"/>
but a marvellous curſed diſtemper? They ſay, the law hath nothing to doe with them, and they live by the law of love; and yet they have not any love to the Lord Jeſus. Muſt the Lord Jeſus Chriſt pardon thy ſinnes, and thou remaine in them? Muſt the Lord Jeſus ſeale to thy ſoule the forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of thine iniquities, and thou dally with it? No, the Love of the Lord Chriſt will compell thee to doe any thing to give contentment to the Lord Jeſus.<note place="margin">Eſa. 57.15. Pſal. 51.17.</note> An humble heart is the onely houſe where Chriſt dwells, and the onely ſacrifice that he accepts of, and the onely guiſe of ſpirit that Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt lookes to: and if thou love the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, thou muſt be ſure to provide this dainty diſh for him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ob.</hi> But ſome will ſay, What need have I of this ſorrow, ſeeing Chriſt Jeſus muſt doe all?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> I anſwer, What need then haſt thou of faith, for Chriſt muſt in that do all for thee? Though I doe not ſay thou haſt as much need of ſorrow and brokenneſſe of heart, as of faith,<note place="margin">Continuall ſorrow as needfull, as continuall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving.</note> yet there is a kinde of proportionable need of a continuall ſorrow, as well as of continuall beleeving; and that upon theſe grounds.</p>
               <p>Firſt, thy ſorrow helpes on thy faith, that it may be more ſtrongly carried to Jeſus Chriſt; for the more weight and burden of thy ſinnes thou feeleſt, the more need thou wilt ſee of Chriſt. As it is with a ſharpe ſauce, though it breed not a ſtomacke,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> yet it ſtirres up a ſtomacke; ſo this godly ſorrow, though it is not the worke of beleeving, yet it ſtirres up the
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:4399:140"/>
ſtomacke (of faith) to go goe to the Lord Jeſus: for faith is the going out of the ſoule to Chriſt, and hee that findes the burden of his ſinne, will be the more ready to goe out to Chriſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Againe, this makes a man the more fit to receive the aſſurance of Gods love; this, I ſay, makes the ſoule more ready and fit to receive the evidence of Gods love to be expreſt to the ſoule, which thou canſt not have ſo expreſt to thee, except thou have this godly ſorrow: 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.9. <hi>If wee confeſſe our ſinnes, he is faithfull and juſt to forgive us our ſinnes, and to cleanſe us from all unrighteouſneſſe:</hi> he ſpeaks there of them that now had faith, &amp; yet ſhewes that before the Lord would ſeale to the man that hath faith, the aſſurance of the pardon of his ſinnes, hee will make him humble, and cry, and ſorrow for them, and as to live comfortably, ſo ſorrowfully too: as 1 <hi>King.</hi> 8.38. 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 6.36. <hi>If the people returne to thee in the land of their captivitie, and pray unto thee ſaying, We have ſinned, we have done amiſſe, and have dealt wickedly; then heare thou in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, &amp;c.</hi> When the Lord ſeeth their hearts hum<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>bled for their ſinnes, and ſorrowfull for them, then hee ſeales up the pardon of them. So then the way to have this aſſurance, is to have this frame of ſpirit here ſpoken of.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, this godly ſorrow ought to bee conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually in ſuch as have this love of Chriſt, that ſo our hearts may be carried with a more deadly ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred of ſinne. Theſe are the benefits of godly ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row; and if a man ſorrow not for ſinne, he will not
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:4399:140"/>
ſorrow for the wrong and diſhonour done to God by other ſinfull men: as <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 119.136. <hi>Rivers of waters runne downe mine eyes, becauſe they keepe not thy law. EZech.</hi> 9.4. <hi>The Lord ſayd to the Angel, Goe and ſet a marke upon the foreheads of all the men that ſigh, and that cry for all the abhominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that be done in the midſt thereof.</hi> Now how can a man mourn for the abhominations of others, when he hath not the heart to mourne for it in his owne ſoule?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ob.</hi> But ſome will ſay, Muſt we never rejoyce in the Lord?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> I anſwer, Yes. I ſay, ſorrow daily for thy ſinnes, and yet daily rejoyce in thy Saviour; and the more thy heart is broken for the one, the more thou wilt be comforted by the other. Thou that makeſt no matter of being ſenſible of the body of death that hangs upon thee, and haſt no care to bee ſenſible of thy owne failings, take heed that the Lord give thee not up for ever to thy owne baſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, to be ruſhed headlong into ſome vile ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous courſes, and ſo thou periſh for ever; as wee finde by experience, many, by this meanes, have growne the moſt profane creatures that ever li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved: And this is the damnable hereſie of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliſts.</p>
               <p>The fourth ſort is the vain-glorious hypocrite; and hee is marvellous zealous for God and his truth in outward appearance. That God may bee honoured, and his Goſpel advanced, it is admirable what he will do; he will hazzard himſelfe, his life,
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:4399:141"/>
his eſtate and all, nay be content not to live, if he may but leave a little vaine breath after him. Wee know what vaine-glory doth amongſt the Papiſts, who, that they may be canonized for Saints, will endure any thing, and ſuffer death it ſelfe: this vain-glory is above life and all.<note place="margin">Simile.</note> As ſome great Courti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers will doe by a man that they meane to make a booty of, they make him their onely favorite, and expreſſe a great deale of kindneſſe to him, that hee may helpe them to more honour and glory: So this wretch doth lift up the Goſpel, that the Goſpel may advance him, and fill his ſailes full of winde: therefore he will doe great matters for this end, that hee may receive glory from it. Even as the Stage-player that ſets up a great ſtage that he may be above the people;<note place="margin">Another.</note> ſo it is with a vain-glorious wretch; prayer is a good ſtage, and faſting, and hearing, and preaching are very fine ſtages for him, upon which he acts his part, that others may ſee him, that glory may come to him, and not that the glory and grace of Chriſt may bee extolled: hee would lift up himſelfe to heaven, and caſt downe Chriſt to hell. Such an one was <hi>Saul:</hi> when <hi>Samuel</hi> gave him the left hand, and would not go with him into the Citie, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15.30. <hi>He ſaid, I have ſinned, yet honour me I pray thee before the people, and turne again with me, that I may worſhip the Lord thy God:</hi> Walke with me, and then the people will ſay, Oh what good friends they bee! ſurely hee is a good man, the Prophet goes with him. It is a great honour to thoſe that are wiſe, becauſe they are willing to
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:4399:141"/>
joyne ſide with thoſe that are holy and gracious; ſo <hi>Saul</hi> will honour <hi>Samuel,</hi> that <hi>Samuel</hi> may honour him, and that he may ſtand upon his ſhoulders, as it were, that the people may ſay, See how inward they are, and what a good man hee is, the Prophet goes on with him: but the turne and the iſſue of the hypocrite is this, it is meerly for himſelfe; which will appeare thus: If once the winde begin to turne, and the gale of honour grow ſomewhat cold, and other men are a little lifted up, ſo that he may not bee in the fore-front; or if his profeſſion will not carry him out with honour, but his credit is laid in the duſt, and hee ſees hee cannot get honour, his heart dies in him, and he ſaith, It is as good to leave off all: and if he cannot get glory from the Goſpel, either hee will grow deſperately wicked and oppoſe the Goſpell, and joyne ſide with the wicked, and helpe them; or elſe he will flagge and die in a baſe carnall courſe, and come to nothing; and thats the beſt of him. This hath been the bane of many men, who, when they have miſſed of the glory that they lookt for from the Goſpel, they have become perſecuters: Theſe men deal with Chriſt as the Inne-keeper doth with his gueſts; If a man will pay the Ordinarie,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> he is welcome, but if once his money faile, hee turnes him out of doores: ſo if Chriſt will pay his Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary, and if hee may have credit and honour, ſo as men may ſay he hath good parts, and that he faſts more than the world knowes; I ſay, if the Goſpel will give him this Ordinary, it is welcome, and he is
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:4399:142"/>
carried on cheerfully: but if Chriſt and the Goſpel will not give him that which hee would have, hee turnes his backe upon it. The Lord Jeſus convince your hearts of it. I take this to be the ſtate of a great many: but a gracious heart is of another ſtraine or temper. Happely God hath given a man parts, and gifts, and credit, and yet if the Lord withdraw him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, a good ſoule ſaith as <hi>John</hi> did, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.40. <hi>Hee muſt encreaſe, I muſt decreaſe;</hi> ſo a good heart ſaith, If another man deſerve and have more than I, yet let this proud heart licke the duſt, and never lift up it ſelfe; if the Lord Jeſus may encreaſe, and have his honour and glory, let me be trodden in the duſt: this is a heart worth gold. When a man entertaines the King, he is content, though the King put him out of his owne houſe, to bee his ſervant for the while; and if his Majeſty may be contented, he cares not: ſo it is with a gracious humble heart, if the Lord will blaſt a mans parts and comforts, and take all from him, and give him Chriſt naked, and onely that honour that is in him, hee is contented: This heart is right, and hee will ſay, It is Gods will to take away theſe parts, honours, credit, &amp;c. and if the Lord Jeſus ſay, I will not aſſiſt nor comfort thy ſoule, he lyes downe and ſaith not a word, but this, Let the Lord be honoured though I be as the dung in the ſtreets; whatſoever become of me, though I be damned, ſo the Lords glory may be advanced, I am content. Suppoſe this ſhould be (which indeed cannot be) that a man were left deſtitute of al com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, friends, and meanes, and all that he hath lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:4399:142"/>
heretofore, and in ſtead of honour were to have ſhame; and impriſonment for liberty; and want and diſhonour in ſtead of friends: the ſoule ſaith, It is Gods will to doe ſo, and to take away honour and parts, who muſt order the buſineſſe but he one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly? Doth it pleaſe the Lord Jeſus to doe ſo? bleſſed bee his name for it, I ſhall now be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented, let me lye at his feet; though I goe downe to hell let me wait on him, and let him doe what he will.</p>
               <p>Now all you that are of any of theſe ſorts, to you is the Word of the Lord ſpoken this day, and I beſeech you in the name of Chriſt, take it in love, and as ſpoken out of indignation to your ſinnes: to you, I ſay, the Miniſter and the Word ſaith, The Lord bee mercifull to you, you are haters of the Lord Jeſus, there is none of the love of God in the hearts of any of this generation to this day. Now do not goe away and ſay, Let the Miniſter ſay what he will, for hee muſt ſay ſomething to hold out the houre: What? wilt thou ſhew thy ſelfe to bee a moſt notorious wrangling hypocrite? Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, ſpeake, is not thy heart met withall, as in all the former particulars? Conſcience ſaith ſo, and the Lord ſaith ſo; Oh be perſwaded therefore, and yeeld the bucklers, and ſay, Now I ſee it is not in truth, all that I have done is wrong and falſe; Oh that I could once at laſt fall upon the right way! The Lord perſwade your hearts to conceive of it, and to ſay, I am ſtill a hater of Chriſt, I am yet an enemy; Do I yet live to be ſaved by Chriſt,

               <p n="1">1. Thinke thus much with thy ſelfe, This ſinne of all other is moſt unconceivable, and not to bee named, much leſſe to bee practiſed and retained. Oh that ever any wretch that hath received ſo much from Chriſt, ſhould ſtill hate him! Good Lord, that ever there ſhould bee ſuch a wretch upon the earth! and yet Lord I am the man, I am hee that have approved of the practiſes of the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked: thou art an open enemy to the Lord Jeſus, and therefore thinke what thou haſt done all this while. <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.19, 20. <hi>That which may be known of God, is manifest in the creatures.</hi> But in the meane time thinke but what thy ſinne is, that thou haſt not onely the creatures to preach to thee, but the Lord Jeſus who came downe from heaven: It is a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that ever he came for ſuch wretches as we are; hee hath torne his bowels in pieces for thee, and entreated thee to bathe thy ſoule in his death, and bee ſaved for ever;<note place="margin">Luke 19.42.</note> yea, hee hath wept over thee, and ſaid, <hi>Oh that thou hadſt knowne, even thou at leaſt in this thy day, the things which belong unto thy peace,</hi> yet thou regardeſt not.

You know the ſpirit of love hath met you in your Churches, and in your houſes, and walked with you in your journeies, and ſaid,

Now open, the Lord Jeſus calls &amp; tenders mercy, and you have ſnubbed it. Good Lord, is it poſſible that the blood of Jeſus Chriſt ſhould ſpeake to us, and that a company of wretched creatures ſhould trample upon that blood, and grieve that ſpirit, rather then forſake their luſts and corruptions! You children tell your fathers of this, and you wives your husbands, and ſay, Is it poſſible that we have done this, and yet live ſtill? it is a wonder. Therefore reaſon thus with your ſelves, and ſay, If a heathen ſhall be condemned that had but trees preaching to him, and his conſcience open; then what ſhall become of me, that have had Chriſt and his blood to preach to me? what will become of me? what ſin is mine? it is a ſcarlet ſin, it hath in it all abominations.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Secondly, thinke of thy ſorrow, how will the Lord Jeſus be revenged on thee! Doeſt thou ſay, Oh he is mercifull, and will forgive all? What wil the Lord ſuffer his ſonne to be trampled upon will God the Father ſuffer this? thinke what will be the end of it; Oh thy judgement is intolerable and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recoverable, continuing as thou art. Conſider the heavineſſe of thy plagues: 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16.22. <hi>If any man love not the Lord Jeſus Chriſt; let him be</hi> had in exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration, or bee accurſed, or bee made <hi>Maranatha;</hi> that is, All the curſes of heaven and earth, and all the curſes of the world, to the higheſt ſtraine of cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing: as if he ſhould ſay, All you Churches on earth, and all you Angels in heaven, curſe ye that man, and all ye Divels in hell torment that man,
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:4399:144"/>
nay, let him be accurſed for ever; and then, bleſſed Redeemer, take this man into thy owne hands, and let him be accurſed for ever: As in <hi>Jude</hi> 14. <hi>And Enoch alſo the ſeventh from Adam, prohecied of theſe, ſaying, Behold the Lord commeth with tenne thouſands of his Saints, to execute judgement upon all, and to convince all that are ungodly among them, of all their ungodly deeds which they have ungodly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, and of all their hard ſpeeches, which ungodly ſinners have ſpoken againſt him.</hi> You thinke it is nothing to ſpeake againſt the Lord Jeſus; thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of Angels ſhall miniſter to him, and ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands ſhall goe before him, and ſay, The Lord is comming to execute judgement upon all that work wickedneſſe, and upon thoſe that have ſpoken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him. So that when the Church of Chriſt, and the Angels in heaven, and the Divels in hell have conſpired to torment a man, then alſo the Lord Jeſus will come to torment him. Oh that my heart could bleed, and if it were poſſible, breake in ſunder for the miſery in which you are: in that day the Lord Jeſus will ſay to ſuch, as hee doth <hi>Luke</hi> 19.27. <hi>Thoſe mine enemies which would not that I ſhould raigne over them, bring hither and ſlay them before me:</hi> He will ſay, Bring hither that enemy of mine, he hath oppoſed mee, and grieved my ſpirit, and ſleighted my mercy; bring my enemies hither, not the Heathens or Pagans, I regard not them ſo much, but him that hath beene a hater of me and of my Goſpel; and then ſhalt thou ſee the intolerable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and unavoydableneſſe of thy puniſhment.

Oh poore ſoule, what wilt thou ſay or doe when thou art put to ſuch a plunge; (as <hi>Joſephs</hi> bowels did earne within him when hee talked with his bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, that he could forbeare no longer, I wiſh that I had a heart to mourne in ſecret for thee) I ſay, what will become of thee, poore wretch? Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pely thou wilt ſay, there is mercy: It's true, but thou haſt hated that mercy, which ſhould ſave thee: or, wilt thou thinke that the blood and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of the Lord Jeſus will ſave thee, thou haſt trod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den upon them. Wilt thou ſay, The good ſpirit of the Lord will prevaile with this wretched heart of mine? with what heart canſt thou crave aide from the ſpirit, when thy owne conſcience can ſay, I have hated that good ſpirit of the Lord, and that mercy which ſhould ſave mee? And when all is done and thou art come to the period, goe your way home to your husbands and wives and mourn for them, for there is neither mercy nor Chriſt for them, for they alſo have hated him. And when this is done, imagine thou didſt ſee the heavens opened, and the fire melting round about thee, and the Lord Chriſt coming in flaming fire, rendering vengeance to all that obey not the Goſpel, lay thy hand upon thy breaſt &amp; ſay, that's I Lord, that's my husband, or my childe, he is come againſt us, to render ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance to them that have lived with mee, and have oppoſed the Goſpel, and the riches of grace and of mercy in Jeſus Chriſt.

               <p n="1">1. Firſt, there are ſome hinderances to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Secondly, labour to ſee the beauty and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencie of Jeſus Chriſt in the promiſe.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Thirdly, when the promiſe is come neere, and the heart made empty, then learne the skill to make the ſoule and the promiſe meet.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Meanes, 1.</note>Firſt, that you may love the Lord Chriſt, there are ſome hinderances which lye upon the heart, which are marvellous cauſes of diſſention between Jeſus Chriſt and the ſoule, and theſe muſt be taken away. Now the hinderances of this ſort are theſe three.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, 1.</note>The firſt is this, To take off the ſoule from the love of theſe baſe things here below. I beſeech you obſerve it, be marvellous wiſe that you laviſh not out your ſoules upon theſe lying vanities: for as it is with a ſtreame,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> if the banke be cut, and all the ſtreame run that way then the proper chanell muſt needs lie dry, becauſe all the ſtreame runs another way; ſo is it with the ſtreame of a mans affections, if the ſtream of love &amp; joy be let out upon profits, or pleaſures, or honours, you cannot have &amp; ſpend, you cannot have your affections ſtill, when you have ſpent them upon other things; therefore bee ſure to knocke them off from the world, that you may give them wholly to the Lord. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2 15. <hi>Little children love not the world.</hi> What if we doe,
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:4399:146"/>
may ſome ſay: <hi>If any man love the world, the love of the Father is not in him.</hi> You muſt not think to have heaven and hell too, to have Chriſt and the world too: It is impoſſible in reaſon, that a wiſe ſhould have a true affection of love to her husband, and an adulterous affection to her filthy mates too; the mate muſt be abandoned before the husband can be loved as he ought to be. <hi>Jam.</hi> 4.4 <hi>Ye adulterers and adultereſſes, know ye not that the friendſhip of the world is enmity with God?</hi> This is meant of ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall adulterers and adultereſſes, thoſe that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw their hearts from the Lord, and have their back-doores for the world; O yee adulterers (ſaith he) know ye not that he that loves the world can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not love God? Theſe two cannot ſtand together; ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther make theſe two at ods, or elſe there can be no love to Jeſus Chriſt.<note place="margin">Another.</note> As it is with the body of a man, when the heart is hot, the heat of the ſunne drawes all the heat outwards, and leaves the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mack cold, inſomuch that many times he ſwelters away; ſo when the profits &amp; pleaſures of the world come marvellous ſtrongly in a good booty or bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, and ſhine hotly upon your fouls, and drawes out your hearts to that, then they are cold to grace, and Chriſt, and the promiſe, as if you were dead men; nay, many a man hath died and periſhed everlaſtingly by this way and meanes. When a Gentleman hath ſtockt his man with money,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> and ſent him to the market for ſuch things as hee hath need of, hee will not lay out his money upon ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles and rattles, becauſe the more he layes out, the
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:4399:147"/>
leſſe hee hath for his market; but he will keep his money together: ſo when the Lord hath ſtockt your ſouls with ſtrength of grace, ſo that now you have very violent affections of love and joy, if you lay out theſe affections upon profits and honours, when you come to provide for Chriſt, all is already ſpent. One man layes out his love upon his luſts, and another upon his chambering, and when they come to Chriſt and grace, then their hearts are dead, and looſe, &amp; adulterous, and have ſpent all. Therefore in a word, when the world, and profits, and honors come &amp; ſay, Let us have ſo much love, and keepe ſo much for Chriſt; tell the world thus, and ſay, Nay, we muſt keepe our choyce affections for the beſt things, we muſt love Chriſt, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let the world ſtay, and let its better be ſerved firſt. This is the firſt hinderance.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance</hi> 2.</note>2 Secondly, take heed, and caſt off thoſe vaine and groundleſſe ſurmiſes and ſuſpitions, which ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Satan caſts in, or thy own heart breeds againſt the Lord Jeſus and his goodneſſe. There is a cavil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling jealouſie which is in every mans heart by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, whereby we are ſubject to thinke hardly, or at leaſt to ſurmiſe ſinfully againſt the Lord and his dealings with us; look how thou doeſt ſuſpect God to be unto thee,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> ſo art thou unto him: As it is with two friends, if they once begin to be jealous of one anothers love, and if I once ſurmiſe in my heart that he hath ſome ill will towards me, this is the next way to breed in my heart an ill-will towards him: therefore be ſure to quit thy heart of theſe.
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:4399:147"/>
A loving conceit makes the thing lovely that wee meddle withall, but a groundleſſe ſuſpition turnes all another way, and alſo makes us thinke ill of the Lord; it takes all with the wrong hand; for, if a man have the bleſſings of this world, then the ſoule ſaith, It is true indeed, God hath given me theſe, but it is as a hook, the Lord makes my table my ſnare, and onely fits me for the ſlaughter: For when the Lord lets in the horror of his wrath into the ſoule, all thoſe bleſſings come to nothing, and are forgotten, becauſe the heart hath God in a jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, and thinkes that God onely fats him to the ſlaughter, and to ruinate him for ever, whereas the Lord could as well deſtroy him preſently as beare ill-will towards him. Againe on the other ſide, if the Lord gives but a ſmall pittance and allowance, then the ſoule ſaith, The Lord loves not me, how ſtraight-handed is he towards me! if he did love me, it would be otherwiſe. As the naughty ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macke turnes the beſt diet into ill humours, and as the greene glaſſe makes all ſeeme greene to him that hath it; ſo it is with the heart that is uncharita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly conceited toward the Lord, for we, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all his loving kindneſſe, ſtill think we have him upon the worſt hand, and are provoked in our hearts againſt him. Therefore take heed of harbou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring any ill thoughts, or groundleſſe ſuſpitious jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſies againſt the God of heaven; this is ordinary, yea, too ordinary with our baſe hearts, a vile heart is a breed-bate, between the Lord and us; for it ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſeth God to the ſoule, and then the ſoule to God:
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:4399:148"/>
and therefore when haply wee labour to bring a poore ſinner to looke towards God, and to conſi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>der of Gods goodneſſe to him, No, no, (ſaith he) It is true, I confeſſe God is very gracious, and it is his goodneſſe that I have the meanes of ſalvation, but I ſhall one day periſh, and God onely ſerves his turne of me, the Lord never gave me that aſſurance of his love that ſuch and ſuch have, God will one day leave me in the lurch. And then the heart is tranſported with a ſecret diſlike of the Lord Jeſus. Wretches that we are! whereas a good and a charitable conceit of God would make a good conſtruction of his dealings, as the wife of <hi>Mano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah</hi> did, <hi>Judg.</hi> 13.22, 23. when <hi>Manoah</hi> offered a ſacrifice, and an Angel appeared (which Angel was the Lord Jeſus Chriſt) he ſaid, <hi>Wee ſhall ſurely dye, for we have ſeene an Angel</hi> (for this was their opinion in ancient times, that if a man did ſee an Angel he ſhould dye:) the Angel received the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, and did wonderfully accept it, and yet hee ſaith, <hi>Wee ſhall ſurely dye.</hi> Here was a groundleſſe ſuſpition: but marke how ſhe reaſons, <hi>If the Lord were pleaſed to kill us, he would not have received a burnt offering and a meat offering at our hands:</hi> as if ſhe had ſaid, Oh doe not you thinke ſo hardly and uncharitably of the Lord, as that he will kill us; why did he thus and thus? we may rather expect good from God, becuſe hee hath done good to us before: So I ſay, and ſo I would have thee to ſay to thy ſoule, The Lord doth mee no harme, and therefore why ſhould I think that he intends any
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:4399:148"/>
unto me? I have received nothing but good from the Lord, and therefore why ſhould I thinke ſo ill of God? Oh take heed of this.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The third hinderance is this,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance</hi> 3.</note> Judging the goodneſſe and kindneſſe of the Lord according to thy owne deſires, what thou wouldſt have; not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter thy owne unworthineſſe, nor the kindneſſe which others doe enjoy better than thy ſelfe; mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muring that thou art not worthy, whereas thou art not fitted that God ſhould do any thing for thee. This miſ-judging many times carries the heart with a ſpeciall miſtaking againſt the Lord: as it is with a poore creature that hath had the meanes, but not received the like comfort and mercy thereby that others have, ſee how the heart reaſons ſaying, O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers have ſuch and ſuch aſſiſtance, in the meane time God leaves me; and ſuch and ſuch have evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of his favour, but God regards not me: had I but ſuch power againſt corruptions, and ſuch evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of Gods love and favour as God hath given to ſuch and ſuch Chriſtians, farre younger than I! I ſeeke, and pray, and intreat, and have not: and with that the heart is carried with a ſecret heart-burning againſt the Lord; this breeds a ſecret kinde of wrangling, and quarrelling, and withdrawing from the Lord. Therefore labour thou to ſtill thoſe diſtempers, and to rectifie thy ſelfe, and to judge as thou oughteſt. Judge not thy ſelfe by what others have, and by what thou deſerveſt, but ſay, Bleſſed be God I am not as I might have been, and bleſſed be God, I am not as I have deſerved: for then I had
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:4399:149"/>
either beene upon the chaine with felons, or upon the gallowes with theeves and robbers, or in the Ale-houſe at my abominations; for my nature is prone to it as well as others. I confeſſe I am not ſo holy as I ought to be, but bleſſed be that mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy in Jeſus Chriſt that I am as I am: I have not what others have, and yet it is a wonder that I have any thing at all at the hands of the Lord, ſo unthankefull and dead-hearted as I am: others are meeke, and patient, and heavenly, and painfull, and therefore it is a wonder that I have any thing at all. Goe thy way, and bee contented with the Lords goodneſſe, and quarrell no more, and miſ-judge the Lords kindneſſe no more. Thus you ſee the hindrances removed; now there is a way made, that the ſoule may come to ſome termes of love with God.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Meanes</hi> 2.</note>2. When the ſoule hath beene thus ordered, we muſt labour to bee throughly acquainted with the beauty and ſweetneſſe of Chriſt in the promiſe, that this may provoke our ſoules to love the Lord, and to rejoyce in him. When theſe hindrances are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved, there is way made for the promiſe to come and meet with the ſoule, theſe breed-bates are ſent out of towne, and now there may be ſome poſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of love, and this is the next way to worke and draw our hearts to Chriſt, and to kindle in us theſe affections of love and joy.</p>
               <p>The ſoule that is looſened from all the cauſes of jarres and diſſentions betweene Chriſt and him; that ſoule is ready to match with the promiſe,
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:4399:149"/>
and to beſtow it ſelfe in love upon Chriſt. In a marriage a man muſt know the party firſt, and the portion, and underſtand both, or elſe he can love neither; ſo thou muſt ſee the beauty and excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of the promiſe before thou canſt love the Lord Jeſus. As it is in the baſer affections, the covetous man ſeeth a good bargaine before hee loves it: ſo that it is the eye that makes the bargaine, as one well obſerves; ſo thou muſt looke wiſely upon the promiſes, and be able to know them, and this will make thee love them: as in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 91.14. <hi>Becauſe he hath ſet his love upon me, therefore will I deliver him: I will ſet him on high, becauſe he hath knowne my Name.</hi> How came he to love the name of the Lord? becauſe he knew him; as it is <hi>Cant.</hi> 1.2. when the name of our Saviour <hi>was as an ointment powred forth, then did the virgins love him:</hi> this name is the graces of our Saviour revealed and communicated to us: and <hi>Cant.</hi> 4.9. ſee what our Saviour ſaith, <hi>My ſiſter, my ſpouſe, thou haſt raviſhed my heart with one of thine eyes, with one chaine of thy necke:</hi> this is by way of compariſon from the leſſe to the greater: the Spouſe of Chriſt is the Church of Chriſt, and by eye and neck is meant nothing elſe but the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of his grace in the heart truely humbled; now the Lord Jeſus Chriſt lookes upon theſe graces, and loves them, and is raviſhed with the fight of them. Now if the worke of grace in the heart of a poore ſinner raviſhed the heart of Chriſt, who is the God of all grace, then much more if our hearts could but ſee one finger of the excellency that is in Chriſt,
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:4399:150"/>
they would bee raviſhed with earneſt love, and kindled with violence towards him. There are three things that ought mainely to bee reſpected in the promiſe, that we may eye and apprehend, and that our hearts may be kindled with love to the Lord; and theſe three worke love any where.</p>
               <p>Firſt, the worth of the party in himſelfe.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the deſert of the party.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, the readineſſe of the party in himſelfe to ſeeke our good.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Three things in Chriſt to make us love him.</note>So it is with the Lord Jeſus, firſt, he is worthy of our love, in himſelfe conſidered.</p>
               <p>Secondly, he hath deſerved it.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, he ſeekes our love. Thou that dwelleſt in a poore cottage, wilt hardly beleeve this; but I ſay, he ſeekes thy love.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Chriſt is worthy in himſelfe. I wonder that the Lord Jeſus Chriſt will ſuffer himſelfe to be beloved by ſuch wretches as wee are: if wee had a thouſand hearts to beſtow upon him, we were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver able to love him ſufficiently: for as <hi>Nehemiah</hi> ſaid,<note place="margin">Nehem. 9.5.</note> 
                  <hi>The name of the Lord is above all praiſe:</hi> and as the name of God is above all praiſe that wee can give him, ſo the name of the Lord is above all the love that we can beſtow upon him. Will you let out your love and affections? (as wee uſe to ſay in the market) it is a good penny worth, it is worth more money than you ſhall pay for it: ſo if you will lay out all the affections that you have, you may lay them out here, and that with good advantage too. What would you have? you may have enough for
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:4399:150"/>
your money: Wouldſt thou have beauty? then thy Saviour is beautifull: <hi>Pſal.</hi> 45.2. <hi>Thou art fairer than the children of men;</hi> yea, he is full of grace: nay, the Spouſe, <hi>Cant.</hi> 5.10. ſaith, <hi>My beloved is the cheife of ten thouſand:</hi> and in the 16. verſe, <hi>Hee is altogether lovely,</hi> hee is a very beautifull husband. There is no beauty in the world, but it hath its ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh, nor no day ſo faire but it hath its clouds; but the Lord Jeſus Chriſt is altogether love: if beauty will pleaſe thee, he is altogether excellent. Would you have ſtrength? <hi>Pſal.</hi> 45.3. hee is all ſtrength: A wife would not have a cowardly husband, therefore the Text ſaith, <hi>Gird thy ſword upon thy thigh, O most mighty, ride on proſperouſly;</hi> ſo that Kings are ſlaine, and people ſhall fall before him, <hi>and his right hand ſhall teach thee terrible things,</hi> therefore, if beauty will pleaſe thee, he is the fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt of all: if ſtrength will pleaſe thee, hee is the ſtrongeſt of all: if riches will pleaſe thee, hee is more rich (if it bee poſſible) than he is ſtrong; for <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.2. he is the heire of all things; he is not for a Crowne, or a Kingdome, or lands, or revenues, but the heavens are his, and the earth, and the ſea farre and wide, and all the depths thereof are his, yea, and thine alſo, if thou wilt have him: Hee is rich likewiſe, in regard of his grace, as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.3. <hi>In him are hid all the treaſures of wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and knowledge.</hi> What wouldſt thou have? eternall life and happineſſe? then he that hath Chriſt, hath all theſe: for Chriſt is the Author of life and happineſſe to all that have him; and hee
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:4399:151"/>
hath not onely theſe in himſelfe, but hee will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feoffe thee in them, if thou wilt but match with him. If the world, and beauty, and ſtrength, and life, and ſalvation will prevaile, it is all thine; let the Lord Jeſus Chriſt once have your love, and it is done. See what the Prophet <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 63.3. <hi>Thy loving kindneſſe is better than life,</hi> therefore <hi>my lips ſhall praiſe thee.</hi> You know what we uſe to doe in the world: if a man match with a maid where there is much wealth, wee ſay he is made for ever; ſo ſay I: Truly the world cannot, nor will not doe ſo for you; it promiſeth faire, and performes nothing. If thou ſet thy heart upon riches and honours, they will faile thee. Where is all the beauty of the world? Some ſickneſſe or other makes many a men ready to run out of his wits for griefe: A man is here in health to day, and in hell to morrow; but if thou wilt love the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, he will never faile thee: he one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is worthy of the choyce of thy affections, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſet them not upon that which cannot comfort thee: if thou wilt have Chriſt, ſet them upon him, and all that he hath is thine.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Chriſt, as he is worthy of our love, ſo he deſerves it; if his worth cannot win our love, yet let his deſert have it. It is a great matter to win the affections of a man. If a man be never ſo wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of himſelfe, for his parts, and gifts, yet if hee have wronged me, and dealt baſely with me, and expreſt the part of an enemy, ſaith a woman, I will not have him, no not though he had all the world:
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:4399:151"/>
But it is not ſo with the Lord Jeſus Chriſt: for as hee is worthy of all love in himſelfe, ſo hee hath dealt mercifully and graciouſly with you, and therefore he deſerves your love; deale equally with him, and give him what he deſerves. We have had hard dealings from the world, and baſe uſage from theſe baſe things, never a man here but hath found it ſo; for it hath promiſed much, and done no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, and all the pleaſures it affoorded us, have left nothing but vanity and emptineſſe behinde them. Let the adulterer come forth, and ſhew what plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure he hath ever had by his filthy dalliances and baſe courſes: he hath had but an ill match, a galled conſcience for the preſent, and the expectation of plagues and puniſhments for ever. The world alſo hath vexed the covetous man, and pleaſure hath diſquieted the ambitious man; but the Lord Jeſus Chriſt hath ever dealt graciouſly and mercifully with his ſervants. In your ſickneſſe who helped you? in your want who ſupplied you? in anguiſh of heart who revived you? was it not the Lord Jeſus Chriſt? and therefore doe not onely what religion requires, but what reaſon requires. If you love them that love you, doe not the Publicanes even the ſame? they doe good to ſuch as doe good to them. The Lord Jeſus Chriſt hath loved you, therefore love you him, and enlarge your hearts to him for ever.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ob.</hi> Oh but (ſaith the ſoule) I confeſſe the Lord hath been mercifull, and it is his mercie that I live, and he hath inlarged himſelfe towards me, but yet
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:4399:152"/>
I grow graceleſſe. What love is this if the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt give me theſe, and deny me that which is better than theſe? what love is this? I now ſpeake to all that want aſſurance; To all ſuch I anſwer in three things.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Three things done by Chriſt for a ſinner, though as yet he want aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.</note>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> I will tell thee what he hath done for thee, taking thy ſelfe in the worſt condition.</p>
               <p>Firſt, conſider that thou liveſt in the boſome of the Church, and that Jeſus Chriſt hath brought life and immortality to light by the Goſpel; ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thouſands of poore Infidels and Heathen would bee glad to gather the crummes that fall from thy Table. The Heathens never knew the way to a Saviour, they never had the meanes to comfort them; and is not this mercy then, that God hath brought the word of life and ſalvation to thee, and ſet thee under the meanes? for he hath not dealt ſo with other Nations, neither have the Heathen knowledge of his wayes: he hath not dealt ſo with many better than thy ſelfe, I meane better, in regard of many actuall tranſgreſſions of thine. Oh therefore love him for this favour.</p>
               <p>Secondly, conſider farther what the Lord Chriſt hath done for thee; he hath not onely brought the meanes of grace to thee, and planted thee in a land of <hi>Goſhen,</hi> where thou didſt enjoy them, but after thou hadſt reſiſted and oppoſed them, and caſt his kindneſſe behind thy backe, and ſleighted his Spirit, ſinfull wretch that thou art, he hath often come and intreated thee to receive mercy; and though againe and againe thou haſt oppoſed it, yet he hath beene
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:4399:152"/>
patient and good to thee: love him for it. Again, the Lord Chriſt takes no advantage againſt thee, as thou ſurmiſeſt: He might have done it, and that juſtly too; thou that reſiſteſt the meanes of grace, it is juſt that thou ſhouldſt never have them. If God had ſent thee one way, and the Goſpel another, it had beene juſt; but hee hath not done ſo: therefore love him, he deſerves it at thy hands.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, he hath not onely brought thee under the meanes of grace, and beene patient to thee, though thou haſt reſiſted the meanes; but he hath let in ſome inkling of his love, and come neerer to thee than all this. Why ſhould Jeſus Chriſt offer mercy to thy wife and child? it is extraordinary kindnes: thou canſt not but know that there are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny in the ſame family, that have the ſame means, and yet remaine in a miſerable condition: and why are thy eyes opened, and thy conſcience awakened in any meaſure? every morning you riſe, and every night you goe to bed, bleſſe and magnifie the Lord Chriſt that hath dealt thus mercifully with you; for he is worthy of it, as <hi>Jude</hi> ſaid,<note place="margin">Joh. 14.22.</note> 
                  <hi>Why wilt thou re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veale thy ſelfe to us, and not to the world?</hi> why wilt thou ſhew mercy to a poore cottage, and enlighten a blind minde, and a ſottiſh ſpirit in this manner? Oh this is love, Oh love him againe for it, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves it.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Chriſt ſeeks thy love; here is the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration of mercy, that our Saviour that hath been rejected by a company of ſinfull creatures, ſhould ſeeke their love: for ſhame refuſe him not, but let
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:4399:153"/>
him have love before he goe. Had the Lord recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved us when we had come unto him, and humbled our hearts before him with deepe importunity; and had he heard us when we had cryed unto him, nay, when we had ſpent all our daies, and all our ſtrength in begging and craving one good looke from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and at the day of our departure taken compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion upon us, it had beene an infinite mercy; but when the Lord Jeſus Chriſt ſhall ſeeke to us by his meſſengers (as all the Miniſters are his meſſengers) to accept of his love, this is beyond all expreſſion: I ſay, if he had onely ſent a love letter from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and ſaid that he was willing to match with us, and had left us to finde out the way and the means, it had beene beyond all wonder; but that the Lord Jeſus Chriſt ſhould come and wait upon us, and ſeek our love, it is the wonder of mercies. When a company of baſe luſts and ſinfull deſires have found acceptance with us, and the doore hath been open upon all occaſions to talke with them, though the Lord Jeſus Chriſt hath often come and ſaid, Oh muſe upon my name, and not upon the world and theſe luſts; and we would not heare him: when, I ſay, you and your adultereſſes have beene upon the bed of dalliance, and Chriſt hath beene at the doore, and could get no audience, nor acceptance: yet after all this, he hath not onely call'd, but ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly beſought us to be reconciled to him, that is, to love him, and to be beloved of him, and bleſſed by him for ever; theſe are the tearmes of his love. What ſhall I anſwer the Lord? will the Lord ſeek
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:4399:153"/>
our love? then returne him this anſwer, and ſay, Shall he ſeeke love and not have it? ſhall he crave it, and I not give it? Oh God forbid. Can the Lord Jeſus Chriſt be in love with me? In truth Lord I am out of love with my ſelfe, by reaſon of my baſe heart, and filthy thoughts; I have abuſed thy Majeſty from time to time, by following my baſe luſts, adulteries and abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations; I have not only loved the world, but filled my ſelfe therewith: and thus my adulterous heart hath gone away from thee to them. But will the Lord Jeſus love ſuch a wretch as I am? Yes, he will; for the Lord ſaith, <hi>Hoſea</hi> 14.5. <hi>I will heale their backe-ſliding, I will love them freely.</hi> He lookes for no portion, no he will take thee with all thy wants. Is not the Lord worthy of thy love? he deſires no more, and ſure hee deſerves no leſſe. <hi>Deut.</hi> 10.12. when the Lord had recorded all his kindneſſe towards the children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> mark how he inferres this, ſaying, <hi>And now Iſrael, what doth the Lord thy God require of thee, but to feare the Lord thy God, to walk in all his wayes, and to love him, and to ſerve the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy ſoule?</hi> So I ſay to thee, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter all the ſinfull abominations of thy heart, and all thy ſinfull practices committed, what is it that the Lord doth require of thee when all thy ſinnes are pardoned? onely that thou love the Lord thy God with all thy heart. Let me therefore tell you what to doe; get you home, and every one in ſecret la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to deale honeſtly and truely with your owne
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:4399:154"/>
hearts, and make up a match in this manner, and ſay, Is it poſſible that the Lord ſhould looke ſo low? that the great Prince ſhould ſend for the poore peaſant? that Majeſty ſhould ſtoope to meanneſſe? and heaven to earth? and God to man? Hath the Lord offered mercy to me, and doth he require no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of me but to love him again? call upon your owne hearts, I charge you, and ſay thus; Lord, if all the ſight of mine eyes were love, and all the ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of my tongue were love, it were all too little to love thee: Oh let me love thee dearely, O Lord my ſtrength. Say you had a faire offer, and that a poore Miniſter of God did wiſh you well; bee not coy and ſqueamiſh, the Lord may have bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than you every day; lye downe therefore and admire at the mercy of the Lord, that ſhould take a company of poore dead dogges; I ſay, be ſure that you bee not coy and ſqueamiſh: ſay as the Prophet did, <hi>Lift up your heads yee gates, and bee yee lift up yee everlaſting doores, and the King of glory ſhall come in, Pſal.</hi> 24. Now the hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drances are removed, and the promiſes are brought home, wee will come to ſee if the match bee li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked of.</p>

<pb n="292" facs="tcp:4399:155"/>
doe thou by undeniable arguments make good to thy owne ſoule, the unconceivable good that will come to thy ſoule; nay, God hath pawned his truth to thee for it. As it was with <hi>Sechem Hamors</hi> ſon, <hi>Gen.</hi> 34.24. when he would perſwade the Citizens to joine ſide with him, he doth two things; Firſt, he did commune with them in the gates, and then hee ſhewes what undoubted good they ſhould bee ſure to get by it: <hi>Shall not their cattell, and their ſubſtance, and every beaſt that they have bee ours?</hi> and hereby will they conſent, if every one bee cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed as they are.

Yes, every grace of Jeſus Chriſt, and all the comforts, not only of this but of a better life. Wee ſtand demurring upon the matters of agreement; if we might have a good ingagement what would wee doe? lay all theſe aſide, and know, that if thou wilt have Chriſt thou muſt part with all, and then thou ſhalt finde in him what ever thy heart deſires: 1 <hi>Corinthians</hi> 3.23. <hi>All is yours, and yee are Chriſts, and Chriſt is Gods:</hi> ſo I ſay to every of you, if Chriſt bee thine, then all is thine; nay, all the Divells malice ſhall promote that which ſhall make for thy good.
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:4399:155"/>
Therefore, is this ſo, that the Lord Jeſus Chriſt is worthy of your love, and hath deſerved it? is he worthy of more love then all that you have, and doth he ſeeke it? (for he hath ſent me this day to entreat love at the hands and hearts of all you poore ſinners) you then that are in higher rankes and pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, the Lord Chriſt is worthy of your affections, and he doth offer love to all you that are weary and have need, to every poor ſoule: now what an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer ſhall I return to him in the evening? ſhall I ſay, Lord I have tendered thy mercy, and it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed, and they ſleighted thy mercy and thy pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, and they would none of Chriſt; they have taken up their hearts with the world, therefore they cannot give up their hearts to thee? Brethren, it would grieve my heart to returne this anſwer: Chriſt Jeſus becomes a ſuiter to you, and doth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech you through me to be reconciled to him, and to bee bleſſed by him for ever: Will you love the Lord Chriſt? let him have but love from you, that is all he cares for.

               <p>Firſt, in the act of converſion unto God, there is much fear &amp; ſorrow, both by the law condemning, and eſpecially by the Goſpel aggravating ſin to the height of heynouſneſſe. The Chriſtian is <hi>wearie,

This takes away the comfort that others have to the world-ward, and macerates a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an with vexing, grieving, ſighing, praying, faſting: but will procure the <hi>marke</hi> of deliverance in the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill day, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 9.4. and joy with the Church and children of God, for whom ſomtimes he vexed his righteous ſoule, <hi>Eſay</hi> 66.10, 11.

               <p>All this is metaphorically compirſed in the Text, by a figure of ſowing and reaping, uſuall in the Scripture: <hi>Sow to the fleſh or ſpirit: ſow liberally,</hi>

               <p n="1">1.

The very <hi>field wherein they ſow,</hi> is ioyous and wholſome: I meane, the duties they performe, and ordinances they frequent.
